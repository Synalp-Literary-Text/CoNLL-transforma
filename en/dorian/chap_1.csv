in	I-QUOTE
itself	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
mode	I-QUOTE

"	O
I	B-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
get	I-QUOTE
rid	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
brought	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
royalties	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
stars	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
garters	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
elderly	I-QUOTE
ladies	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
gigantic	I-QUOTE
tiaras	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
parrot	I-QUOTE
noses.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
spoke	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
dearest	I-QUOTE
friend.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
took	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
head	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
lionize	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
believe	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
picture	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
mine	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
success	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
chattered	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
penny	I-QUOTE
newspapers	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
nineteenth-century	I-QUOTE
standard	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
immortality.	I-QUOTE

Suddenly	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
myself	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
man	I-QUOTE
whose	I-QUOTE
personality	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
strangely	I-QUOTE
stirred	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
close	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
touching.	I-QUOTE

Our	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
reckless	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
asked	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
introduce	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

Perhaps	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
reckless	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
all.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
inevitable.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
spoken	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
without	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
introduction.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
sure	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
that.	I-QUOTE

Dorian	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
afterwards.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
destined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
And	B-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
describe	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
wonderful	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
man	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

"	O
asked	O
his	O
companion.	O

"	O
I	B-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
goes	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
giving	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
rapid	I-QUOTE
_pr	I-QUOTE
cis_	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
guests.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
remember	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
bringing	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
truculent	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
red-faced	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
gentleman	I-QUOTE
covered	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
orders	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
ribbons	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
hissing	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
ear	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
tragic	I-QUOTE
whisper	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
perfectly	I-QUOTE
audible	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
everybody	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
room	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
astounding	I-QUOTE
details.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
fled.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
myself.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
treats	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
guests	I-QUOTE
exactly	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
auctioneer	I-QUOTE
treats	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
goods.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
either	I-QUOTE
explains	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
tells	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
except	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
wants	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know.	I-QUOTE

If	I-QUOTE

Of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE

all	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
won	I-QUOTE

tell	I-QUOTE

that	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE

nothing	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

have	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE

since	I-QUOTE

in	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
curious	I-QUOTE

wonder	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
understand	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

his	I-QUOTE

has	I-QUOTE
suggested	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE

an	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE

manner	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE

an	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

differently.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
recreate	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE

it	I-QUOTE

what	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE

this	I-QUOTE

realize	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE

Unconsciously	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE

how	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
madness	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
separated	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

invented	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
accounts	I-QUOTE

that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
