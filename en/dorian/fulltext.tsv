THE	O
PREFACE	O
The	O
artist	O
is	O
the	O
creator	O
of	O
beautiful	O
things.	O

To	O
reveal	O
art	O
and	O
conceal	O
the	O
artist	O
is	O
art	O
s	O
aim.	O

The	O
critic	O
is	O
he	O
who	O
can	O
translate	O
into	O
another	O
manner	O
or	O
a	O
new	O
material	O
his	O
impression	O
of	O
beautiful	O
things.	O

The	O
highest	O
as	O
the	O
lowest	O
form	O
of	O
criticism	O
is	O
a	O
mode	O
of	O
autobiography.	O

Those	O
who	O
find	O
ugly	O
meanings	O
in	O
beautiful	O
things	O
are	O
corrupt	O
without	O
being	O
charming.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
fault.	O

Those	O
who	O
find	O
beautiful	O
meanings	O
in	O
beautiful	O
things	O
are	O
the	O
cultivated.	O

For	O
these	O
there	O
is	O
hope.	O

They	O
are	O
the	O
elect	O
to	O
whom	O
beautiful	O
things	O
mean	O
only	O
beauty.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
such	O
thing	O
as	O
a	O
moral	O
or	O
an	O
immoral	O
book.	O

Books	O
are	O
well	O
written	O
,	O
or	O
badly	O
written.	O

That	O
is	O
all.	O

The	O
nineteenth	O
century	O
dislike	O
of	O
realism	O
is	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
Caliban	O
seeing	O
his	O
own	O
face	O
in	O
a	O
glass.	O

The	O
nineteenth	O
century	O
dislike	O
of	O
romanticism	O
is	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
Caliban	O
not	O
seeing	O
his	O
own	O
face	O
in	O
a	O
glass.	O

The	O
moral	O
life	O
of	O
man	O
forms	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
subject-matter	O
of	O
the	O
artist	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
morality	O
of	O
art	O
consists	O
in	O
the	O
perfect	O
use	O
of	O
an	O
imperfect	O
medium.	O

No	O
artist	O
desires	O
to	O
prove	O
anything.	O

Even	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
true	O
can	O
be	O
proved.	O

No	O
artist	O
has	O
ethical	O
sympathies.	O

An	O
ethical	O
sympathy	O
in	O
an	O
artist	O
is	O
an	O
unpardonable	O
mannerism	O
of	O
style.	O

No	O
artist	O
is	O
ever	O
morbid.	O

The	O
artist	O
can	O
express	O
everything.	O

Thought	O
and	O
language	O
are	O
to	O
the	O
artist	O
instruments	O
of	O
an	O
art.	O

Vice	O
and	O
virtue	O
are	O
to	O
the	O
artist	O
materials	O
for	O
an	O
art.	O

From	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
form	O
,	O
the	O
type	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
arts	O
is	O
the	O
art	O
of	O
the	O
musician.	O

From	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
of	O
feeling	O
,	O
the	O
actor	O
s	O
craft	O
is	O
the	O
type.	O

All	O
art	O
is	O
at	O
once	O
surface	O
and	O
symbol.	O

Those	O
who	O
go	O
beneath	O
the	O
surface	O
do	O
so	O
at	O
their	O
peril.	O

Those	O
who	O
read	O
the	O
symbol	O
do	O
so	O
at	O
their	O
peril.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
spectator	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
life	O
,	O
that	O
art	O
really	O
mirrors.	O

Diversity	O
of	O
opinion	O
about	O
a	O
work	O
of	O
art	O
shows	O
that	O
the	O
work	O
is	O
new	O
,	O
complex	O
,	O
and	O
vital.	O

When	O
critics	O
disagree	O
,	O
the	O
artist	O
is	O
in	O
accord	O
with	O
himself.	O

We	O
can	O
forgive	O
a	O
man	O
for	O
making	O
a	O
useful	O
thing	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
admire	O
it.	O

The	O
only	O
excuse	O
for	O
making	O
a	O
useless	O
thing	O
is	O
that	O
one	O
admires	O
it	O
intensely.	O

All	O
art	O
is	O
quite	O
useless.	O

The	O
studio	O
was	O
filled	O
with	O
the	O
rich	O
odour	O
of	O
roses	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
light	O

through	O
the	O

door	O
the	O
heavy	O
scent	O
of	O
the	O
lilac	O

or	O
the	O
more	O

of	O
the	O
pink-flowering	O
thorn.	O

From	O
the	O
corner	O
of	O
the	O
divan	O
of	O
Persian	O
saddle-bags	O
on	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
lying	O
,	O
smoking	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
his	O
custom	O
,	O
innumerable	O
cigarettes	O
,	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
Wotton	O
could	O
just	O
catch	O
the	O
gleam	O
of	O
the	O
honey-sweet	O
and	O
honey-coloured	O
blossoms	O
of	O
a	O
laburnum	O
,	O
whose	O
tremulous	O
branches	O
seemed	O
hardly	O
able	O
to	O
bear	O
the	O
burden	O
of	O
a	O
beauty	O
so	O
flamelike	O
as	O
theirs	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
fantastic	O
shadows	O
of	O
birds	O
in	O
flight	O
flitted	O
across	O
the	O
long	O
tussore-silk	O
curtains	O
that	O
were	O
stretched	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
huge	O
window	O
,	O
producing	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
momentary	O
Japanese	O
effect	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
him	O
think	O
of	O
those	O
pallid	O
,	O
jade-faced	O
painters	O
of	O
Tokyo	O
who	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O
an	O
art	O
that	O
is	O
necessarily	O
immobile	O
,	O
seek	O
to	O
convey	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
swiftness	O
and	O
motion.	O

The	O
sullen	O
murmur	O
of	O
the	O
bees	O
shouldering	O
their	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
long	O
unmown	O
grass	O
,	O
or	O
circling	O
with	O
monotonous	O
insistence	O
round	O
the	O
dusty	O
gilt	O
horns	O
of	O
the	O
straggling	O
woodbine	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
stillness	O
more	O
oppressive.	O

The	O
dim	O
roar	O
of	O
London	O
was	O
like	O
the	O
bourdon	O
note	O
of	O
a	O
distant	O
organ.	O

In	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
clamped	O
to	O
an	O
upright	O
easel	O
,	O
stood	O
the	O
full-length	O
portrait	O
of	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
of	O
extraordinary	O
personal	O
beauty	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
some	O
little	O
distance	O
away	O
,	O
was	O
sitting	O
the	O
artist	O
himself	O
,	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
,	O
whose	O
sudden	O
disappearance	O
some	O
years	O
ago	O
caused	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
such	O
public	O
excitement	O
and	O
gave	O
rise	O
to	O
so	O
many	O
strange	O
conjectures.	O

As	O
the	O
painter	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
gracious	O
and	O
comely	O
form	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
skilfully	O
mirrored	O
in	O
his	O
art	O
,	O
a	O
smile	O
of	O
pleasure	O
passed	O
across	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
about	O
to	O
linger	O
there.	O

But	O
he	O
suddenly	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
closing	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
placed	O
his	O
fingers	O
upon	O
the	O
lids	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
he	O
sought	O
to	O
imprison	O
within	O
his	O
brain	O
some	O
curious	O
dream	O
from	O
which	O
he	O
feared	O
he	O
might	O
awake.	O

Intellect	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
itself	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
mode	I-QUOTE

exaggeration	I-QUOTE

then	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
Church	I-QUOTE

fascinating	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE

if	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
allowed	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE

don	I-QUOTE

Something	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
verge	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
terrible	I-QUOTE
crisis	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
strange	I-QUOTE
feeling	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
fate	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
store	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
joys	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
sorrows.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
grew	I-QUOTE
afraid	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
turned	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
quit	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
room.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
conscience	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
:	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
cowardice.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE

for	I-QUOTE
trying	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE

I	B-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
brought	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
royalties	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
stars	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
elderly	I-QUOTE
ladies	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
gigantic	I-QUOTE
tiaras	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
parrot	I-QUOTE
noses.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
spoke	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
dearest	I-QUOTE
friend.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
took	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
head	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
lionize	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
believe	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
picture	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
mine	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
success	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
chattered	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
penny	I-QUOTE
newspapers	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
nineteenth-century	I-QUOTE
standard	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
immortality.	I-QUOTE

Suddenly	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
myself	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
man	I-QUOTE
whose	I-QUOTE
personality	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
strangely	I-QUOTE
stirred	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
close	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
touching.	I-QUOTE

Our	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
reckless	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
asked	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
introduce	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

Perhaps	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
reckless	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
all.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
inevitable.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
spoken	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
without	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
introduction.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
sure	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
that.	I-QUOTE

Dorian	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
afterwards.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
destined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
And	B-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
describe	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
wonderful	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
man	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

"	O
asked	O
his	O
companion.	O

"	O
I	B-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
goes	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
giving	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
rapid	I-QUOTE
_pr	I-QUOTE
cis_	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
guests.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
remember	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
bringing	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
truculent	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
red-faced	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
gentleman	I-QUOTE
covered	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
orders	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
ribbons	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
hissing	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
ear	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
tragic	I-QUOTE
whisper	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
perfectly	I-QUOTE
audible	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
everybody	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
room	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
astounding	I-QUOTE
details.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
fled.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
myself.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
treats	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
guests	I-QUOTE
exactly	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
auctioneer	I-QUOTE
treats	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
goods.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
either	I-QUOTE
explains	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
tells	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
except	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
wants	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know.	I-QUOTE

"	O

and	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE

tell	I-QUOTE

I	B-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
eras	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
importance	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
world	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
history.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
appearance	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
new	I-QUOTE
medium	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
art	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
second	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
appearance	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
new	I-QUOTE
personality	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
art	I-QUOTE
also.	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
invention	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
oil-painting	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
Venetians	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Antinous	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
late	I-QUOTE
Greek	I-QUOTE
sculpture	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
Gray	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
day	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
paint	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
draw	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
sketch	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

Of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
that.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
model	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sitter.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
won	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
dissatisfied	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
art	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
express	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
art	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
express	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
work	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
since	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE

work	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
best	I-QUOTE
work	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
curious	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
understand	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

his	I-QUOTE

has	I-QUOTE
suggested	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
differently	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
differently.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
recreate	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
hidden	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
before.	I-QUOTE

A	O

who	B-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
forget	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE

has	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
visible	I-QUOTE
presence	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
lad	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
seems	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE

little	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
lad	I-QUOTE

though	I-QUOTE

really	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
twenty	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
visible	I-QUOTE
presence	I-QUOTE
ah	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
realize	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
means	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

Unconsciously	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
defines	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
lines	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
fresh	I-QUOTE
school	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
school	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE

in	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

that	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
Greek.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
harmony	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
soul	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
body	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
madness	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
separated	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
invented	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
realism	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
vulgar	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
ideality	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
void.	I-QUOTE

if	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE

Some	I-QUOTE

facts	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE

has	I-QUOTE

People	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE

is	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
superficial.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
may	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE

but	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
superficial	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
is.	I-QUOTE

To	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE

people	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
judge	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
true	I-QUOTE
mystery	I-QUOTE

When	I-QUOTE

more	I-QUOTE
bitter	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
defeats.	I-QUOTE

Every	I-QUOTE

as	I-QUOTE

wanes	I-QUOTE
brings	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
nearer	I-QUOTE

become	I-QUOTE
sallow	I-QUOTE

hollow-cheeked	I-QUOTE

horribly	I-QUOTE

Ah	I-QUOTE

Don	I-QUOTE

your	I-QUOTE
personality	I-QUOTE

could	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
moment	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
saw	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE

how	I-QUOTE
tragic	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE

were	I-QUOTE
wasted.	I-QUOTE

For	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE

at	I-QUOTE
present	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE

not	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
abstruse	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE

was.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
ultimately	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
kinds	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
plain	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
coloured.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
plain	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
useful.	I-QUOTE

If	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
want	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
gain	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
reputation	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
respectability	I-QUOTE

you	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
supper.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
charming.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
commit	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
mistake	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
however.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
paint	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
order	I-QUOTE

try	I-QUOTE

look	I-QUOTE
young.	I-QUOTE

Our	I-QUOTE
grandmothers	I-QUOTE
painted	I-QUOTE

talk	I-QUOTE
brilliantly.	I-QUOTE

_Rouge_	I-QUOTE

_esprit_	I-QUOTE
used	I-QUOTE

go	I-QUOTE

all	I-QUOTE

As	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE

However	I-QUOTE

tell	I-QUOTE

you	I-QUOTE
mustn	I-QUOTE

be	I-QUOTE
unsympathetic	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

After	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
happened	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
filled	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
wild	I-QUOTE
desire	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

For	I-QUOTE
days	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE

something	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
throb	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
veins.	I-QUOTE

As	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
lounged	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
park	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
strolled	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE
Piccadilly	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
used	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
passed	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
mad	I-QUOTE
curiosity	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
lives	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
led.	I-QUOTE

Some	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
fascinated	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

Others	I-QUOTE
filled	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
terror.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
poison	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
air.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
sensations	I-QUOTE
...	I-QUOTE

.	I-QUOTE

Well	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
seven	I-QUOTE
o	I-QUOTE
clock	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
search	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
adventure.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
grey	I-QUOTE
monstrous	I-QUOTE
London	I-QUOTE

its	I-QUOTE

its	I-QUOTE
splendid	I-QUOTE

have	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
store	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
fancied	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
thousand	I-QUOTE
things.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
mere	I-QUOTE
danger	I-QUOTE
gave	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sense	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
delight.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
remembered	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

eastward	I-QUOTE

soon	I-QUOTE
losing	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
labyrinth	I-QUOTE

grimy	I-QUOTE
streets	I-QUOTE

squares.	I-QUOTE

About	I-QUOTE

an	I-QUOTE

with	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE

A	I-QUOTE
hideous	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
amazing	I-QUOTE
waistcoat	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
beheld	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE

was	I-QUOTE
standing	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
entrance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
smoking	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
vile	I-QUOTE
cigar.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
enormous	I-QUOTE
diamond	I-QUOTE

when	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
saw	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
took	I-QUOTE
off	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
hat	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
air	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
gorgeous	I-QUOTE
servility.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
amused	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
monster.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
laugh	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE

but	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
went	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
paid	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
whole	I-QUOTE

for	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

my	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
laughing.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE

horrid	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
laughing	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
greatest	I-QUOTE
romance	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
romance	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
loved	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
love.	I-QUOTE

A	I-QUOTE
_grande	I-QUOTE
passion_	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
privilege	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
do.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
use	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
idle	I-QUOTE
classes	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
country.	I-QUOTE

Don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
afraid.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
store	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

This	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
beginning.	I-QUOTE

"	O

My	B-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
lives	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
shallow	I-QUOTE
people.	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
call	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
loyalty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
fidelity	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
call	I-QUOTE
either	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
lethargy	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
custom	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
lack	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
imagination.	I-QUOTE

Faithfulness	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
emotional	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
consistency	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
intellect	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
confession	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
failure.	I-QUOTE

Faithfulness	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
analyse	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
day.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
property	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
many	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
throw	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
afraid	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
others	I-QUOTE
might	I-QUOTE
pick	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
up.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
want	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
interrupt	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

Go	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
story.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Well	B-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
myself	I-QUOTE
seated	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
horrid	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
private	I-QUOTE
box	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
vulgar	I-QUOTE
drop-scene	I-QUOTE
staring	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
face.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
looked	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
behind	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
curtain	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
surveyed	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
house.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
tawdry	I-QUOTE
affair	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
Cupids	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
cornucopias	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
third-rate	I-QUOTE
wedding-cake.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
gallery	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
pit	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
fairly	I-QUOTE
full	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
rows	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
dingy	I-QUOTE
stalls	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
empty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
person	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
suppose	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
called	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dress-circle.	I-QUOTE

Women	I-QUOTE
went	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
oranges	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
ginger-beer	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
terrible	I-QUOTE
consumption	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
nuts	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
on.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
It	B-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
just	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
palmy	I-QUOTE
days	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
British	I-QUOTE
drama.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Just	B-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
fancy	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
depressing.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
began	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
earth	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
caught	I-QUOTE
sight	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play-bill.	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

"	O

I	B-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
The	I-QUOTE
Idiot	I-QUOTE
Boy	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
Dumb	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
Innocent	I-QUOTE
.	I-QUOTE

Our	I-QUOTE
fathers	I-QUOTE
used	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
piece	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
believe.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
longer	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
live	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
keenly	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
feel	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
whatever	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
enough	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
fathers	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
enough	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
us.	I-QUOTE

In	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
This	B-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
enough	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
Romeo	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
Juliet.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
admit	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
rather	I-QUOTE
annoyed	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
idea	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
seeing	I-QUOTE
Shakespeare	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
wretched	I-QUOTE
hole	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
place.	I-QUOTE

Still	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
interested	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
way.	I-QUOTE

At	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
rate	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
wait	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
act.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
dreadful	I-QUOTE
orchestra	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
presided	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
Hebrew	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
sat	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
cracked	I-QUOTE
piano	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
nearly	I-QUOTE
drove	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
last	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
drop-scene	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
drawn	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
began.	I-QUOTE

Romeo	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
stout	I-QUOTE
elderly	I-QUOTE
gentleman	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
corked	I-QUOTE
eyebrows	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
husky	I-QUOTE
tragedy	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
figure	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
beer-barrel.	I-QUOTE

Mercutio	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
bad.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
played	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
low-comedian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
introduced	I-QUOTE
gags	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
friendly	I-QUOTE
terms	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
pit.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
both	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
grotesque	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
scenery	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
looked	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
country-booth.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
Juliet	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
imagine	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
girl	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
seventeen	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
age	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
flowerlike	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
small	I-QUOTE
Greek	I-QUOTE
head	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
plaited	I-QUOTE
coils	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
dark-brown	I-QUOTE
hair	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
violet	I-QUOTE
wells	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
lips	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
petals	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
rose.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
loveliest	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
pathos	I-QUOTE
left	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
unmoved	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
mere	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
fill	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
tears.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
girl	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
mist	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
tears	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
across	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
heard	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
voice.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
low	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
deep	I-QUOTE
mellow	I-QUOTE
notes	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
fall	I-QUOTE
singly	I-QUOTE
upon	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
ear.	I-QUOTE

Then	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
became	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
louder	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
sounded	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
flute	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
distant	I-QUOTE
hautboy.	I-QUOTE

In	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
garden-scene	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
tremulous	I-QUOTE
ecstasy	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
hears	I-QUOTE
just	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
dawn	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
nightingales	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
singing.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
moments	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
later	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
wild	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
violins.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
stir	I-QUOTE
one.	I-QUOTE

Your	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Sibyl	I-QUOTE
Vane	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
shall	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
forget.	I-QUOTE

When	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
close	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
hear	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
says	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
different.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
follow.	I-QUOTE

Why	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

Night	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
play.	I-QUOTE

One	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
Rosalind	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
next	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
Imogen.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
die	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
gloom	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
Italian	I-QUOTE
tomb	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
sucking	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
poison	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
lover	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
lips.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
watched	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
wandering	I-QUOTE
through	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
forest	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Arden	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
disguised	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
pretty	I-QUOTE
boy	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
hose	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
doublet	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
dainty	I-QUOTE
cap.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
mad	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE

No	I-QUOTE

chatter	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE

Of	B-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE

On	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
theatre	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
horrid	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
round	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
box	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
performance	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
offered	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
behind	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
scenes	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
introduce	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
furious	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
Juliet	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
dead	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
hundreds	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
body	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
lying	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
marble	I-QUOTE
tomb	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
Verona.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
blank	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
amazement	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
under	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
impression	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
taken	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
champagne	I-QUOTE

or	I-QUOTE
something.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
I	B-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
surprised.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Then	B-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
asked	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
wrote	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
newspapers.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
even	I-QUOTE
read	I-QUOTE
them.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
terribly	I-QUOTE
disappointed	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
confided	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dramatic	I-QUOTE
critics	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
conspiracy	I-QUOTE
against	I-QUOTE

that	I-QUOTE

bought.	I-QUOTE

"	O

I	B-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE

was	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
right	I-QUOTE
there.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
hand	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
judging	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
appearance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
expensive.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Well	B-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
beyond	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
means	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
"	O
laughed	O

"	O
By	B-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
however	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
lights	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
put	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
theatre	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
go.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
wanted	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
try	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
cigars	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
strongly	I-QUOTE
recommended.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
declined.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
next	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
arrived	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
place	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

When	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
saw	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
low	I-QUOTE
bow	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
assured	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
munificent	I-QUOTE
patron	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
art.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
offensive	I-QUOTE
brute	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
though	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
extraordinary	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
Shakespeare.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
air	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
pride	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
five	I-QUOTE
bankruptcies	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE
due	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
The	O
Bard	O
,	O
as	B-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
insisted	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
calling	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
distinction.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
It	B-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
distinction	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
dear	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
distinction.	I-QUOTE

Most	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
become	I-QUOTE
bankrupt	I-QUOTE
through	I-QUOTE
having	I-QUOTE
invested	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
heavily	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
prose	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

To	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
ruined	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE

self	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
poetry	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
honour.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
speak	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
The	B-QUOTE
third	I-QUOTE
night.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
playing	I-QUOTE
Rosalind.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
help	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
round.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
thrown	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
flowers	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
looked	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
fancied	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
had.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
persistent.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
behind	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
consented.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
curious	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
wanting	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE

it	I-QUOTE

Oh	I-QUOTE

was	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
shy	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
gentle.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
child	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

Her	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
opened	I-QUOTE
wide	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
performance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
unconscious	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
power.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
both	I-QUOTE
rather	I-QUOTE
nervous.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
stood	I-QUOTE
grinning	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
doorway	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dusty	I-QUOTE
greenroom	I-QUOTE

making	I-QUOTE
elaborate	I-QUOTE

about	I-QUOTE

both	I-QUOTE

while	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
stood	I-QUOTE
looking	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
insist	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
calling	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE

so	B-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE

not	I-QUOTE
anything	I-QUOTE

regarded	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE

person	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
play.	I-QUOTE

his	O

to	O

to	O

the	O
mysteries	O
of	O
life	O
were	O
revealed	O
before	O
the	O

Sometimes	O
this	O

the	O
effect	O
of	O

and	O
chiefly	O
of	O
the	O
art	O
of	O

,	O
which	O
dealt	O
immediately	O
with	O
the	O

But	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
a	O

assumed	O
the	O

of	O

,	O
in	O

,	O
or	O

or	O

Yes	O
,	O
the	O
lad	O
was	O
premature.	O

He	O
was	O
gathering	O
his	O
harvest	O
while	O
it	O
was	O
yet	O
spring.	O

The	O
pulse	O
and	O
passion	O
of	O
youth	O
were	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
becoming	O
self-conscious.	O

It	O
was	O
delightful	O
to	O
watch	O
him.	O

With	O
his	O
beautiful	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
beautiful	O
soul	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
thing	O
to	O
wonder	O
at.	O

It	O
was	O
no	O
matter	O
how	O
it	O
all	O
ended	O
,	O
or	O
was	O
destined	O
to	O
end.	O

He	O
was	O
like	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
gracious	O
figures	O
in	O
a	O
pageant	O
or	O
a	O
play	O
,	O
whose	O
joys	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
remote	O
from	O
one	O
,	O
but	O
whose	O
sorrows	O
stir	O
one	O
s	O
sense	O

and	O
whose	O
wounds	O
are	O

Soul	O
and	O
body	O
,	O
body	O
and	O
soul	O
how	O
mysterious	O
they	O
were	O
!	O

There	O
was	O
animalism	O
in	O
the	O
soul	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
body	O
had	O
its	O
moments	O
of	O
spirituality.	O

The	O
senses	O
could	O
refine	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
intellect	O
could	O
degrade.	O

Who	O
could	O
say	O
where	O
the	O
fleshly	O
impulse	O
ceased	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
psychical	O
impulse	O
began	O
?	O

How	O
shallow	O
were	O
the	O
arbitrary	O
definitions	O
of	O
ordinary	O
psychologists	O
!	O

And	O
yet	O
how	O
difficult	O
to	O
decide	O
between	O
the	O
claims	O
of	O
the	O
various	O
schools	O
!	O

Was	O
the	O
soul	O
a	O
shadow	O
seated	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
sin	O
?	O

Or	O
was	O
the	O
body	O
really	O
in	O
the	O
soul	O
,	O
as	O
Giordano	O
Bruno	O
thought	O
?	O

The	O
separation	O
of	O
spirit	O
from	O
matter	O
was	O
a	O
mystery	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
union	O
of	O
spirit	O
with	O
matter	O
was	O
a	O
mystery	O
also.	O

He	O
began	O
to	O
wonder	O
whether	O
we	O
could	O
ever	O
make	O
psychology	O
so	O
absolute	O
a	O
science	O
that	O
each	O
little	O
spring	O
of	O
life	O
would	O
be	O
revealed	O
to	O
us.	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
we	O
always	O
misunderstood	O
ourselves	O
and	O
rarely	O
understood	O
others.	O

Experience	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
ethical	O
value.	O

It	O
was	O
merely	O
the	O
name	O
men	O
gave	O
to	O
their	O
mistakes.	O

Moralists	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
rule	O
,	O
regarded	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
mode	O
of	O
warning	O
,	O
had	O
claimed	O
for	O
it	O
a	O
certain	O
ethical	O
efficacy	O
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
character	O
,	O
had	O
praised	O
it	O
as	O
something	O
that	O
taught	O
us	O
what	O
to	O
follow	O
and	O
showed	O
us	O
what	O
to	O
avoid.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
motive	O
power	O
in	O
experience.	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
little	O
of	O
an	O
active	O
cause	O
as	O
conscience	O
itself.	O

All	O
that	O
it	O
really	O
demonstrated	O
was	O
that	O
our	O
future	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
our	O
past	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
sin	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
loathing	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
many	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
joy.	O

It	O
was	O
clear	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
experimental	O
method	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
method	O
by	O
which	O
one	O
could	O
arrive	O
at	O
any	O
scientific	O
analysis	O
of	O
the	O
passions	O
;	O
and	O
certainly	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
was	O
a	O
subject	O
made	O
to	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
promise	O
rich	O
and	O
fruitful	O
results.	O

His	O
sudden	O
mad	O
love	O
for	O
Sibyl	O
Vane	O
was	O
a	O
psychological	O
phenomenon	O
of	O
no	O
small	O
interest.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
curiosity	O
had	O
much	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
curiosity	O
and	O
the	O
desire	O
for	O
new	O
experiences	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
simple	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
a	O
very	O
complex	O
passion.	O

What	O
there	O
was	O
in	O
it	O
of	O
the	O
purely	O
sensuous	O
instinct	O
of	O
boyhood	O
had	O
been	O
transformed	O
by	O
the	O
workings	O
of	O
the	O
imagination	O
,	O
changed	O
into	O
something	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
the	O
lad	O
himself	O
to	O
be	O
remote	O
from	O
sense	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
for	O
that	O
very	O
reason	O
all	O
the	O
more	O
dangerous.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
passions	O
about	O
whose	O
origin	O
we	O
deceived	O
ourselves	O
that	O
tyrannized	O
most	O
strongly	O
over	O
us.	O

Our	O
weakest	O
motives	O
were	O
those	O
of	O
whose	O
nature	O
we	O
were	O
conscious.	O

It	O
often	O
happened	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
were	O
experimenting	O
on	O
others	O
we	O
were	O
really	O
experimenting	O
on	O
ourselves.	O

While	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
sat	O
dreaming	O
on	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
a	O
knock	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
valet	O
entered	O
and	O
reminded	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
time	O
to	O
dress	O
for	O
dinner.	O

He	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
looked	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
street.	O

The	O
sunset	O
had	O
smitten	O
into	O
scarlet	O
gold	O
the	O
upper	O
windows	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
opposite.	O

The	O
panes	O
glowed	O
like	O
plates	O
of	O
heated	O
metal.	O

The	O
sky	O
above	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
faded	O
rose.	O

He	O
thought	O
of	O
his	O
friend	O

young	O
fiery-coloured	O
life	O
and	O
wondered	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
all	O

The	I-QUOTE
real	I-QUOTE
drawback	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE

is	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
makes	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE

people	I-QUOTE

there	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
certain	I-QUOTE
temperaments	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
marriage	I-QUOTE
makes	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
complex.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
retain	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
egotism	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
add	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
many	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
egos.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
forced	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
become	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
highly	I-QUOTE
organized	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
highly	I-QUOTE
organized	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
fancy	I-QUOTE

whatever	I-QUOTE

everything	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

you	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
reform	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

for	I-QUOTE

of	I-QUOTE

silly	I-QUOTE

playing	I-QUOTE
Rosalind.	I-QUOTE

Of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
scenery	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
dreadful	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
Orlando	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
Sibyl	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE

her	I-QUOTE
boy	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE

,	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
perfectly	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE

more	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE

Her	I-QUOTE
hair	I-QUOTE
clustered	I-QUOTE
round	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
dark	I-QUOTE

round	I-QUOTE

As	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
acting	I-QUOTE
well	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
shall	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
to-night.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
born	I-QUOTE
artist.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
sat	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dingy	I-QUOTE
box	I-QUOTE
absolutely	I-QUOTE
enthralled.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
forgot	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
London	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
nineteenth	I-QUOTE
century.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
forest	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
man	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
seen.	I-QUOTE

After	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
performance	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
went	I-QUOTE
behind	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
spoke	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

As	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
sitting	I-QUOTE
together	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
suddenly	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
before.	I-QUOTE

My	I-QUOTE
lips	I-QUOTE
moved	I-QUOTE
towards	I-QUOTE
hers.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
kissed	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
describe	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
moment.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
narrowed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
perfect	I-QUOTE
point	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
rose-coloured	I-QUOTE
joy.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
trembled	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
shook	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
white	I-QUOTE
narcissus.	I-QUOTE

Then	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
flung	I-QUOTE
herself	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
knees	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
kissed	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
hands.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
feel	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
help	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

Of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
engagement	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
dead	I-QUOTE
secret.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
even	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
mother.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
guardians	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
say.	I-QUOTE

Lord	I-QUOTE
Radley	I-QUOTE

sure	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
furious.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

be	I-QUOTE

age	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
less	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE
year	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
then	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
like.	I-QUOTE

appeared	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
changed.	O

The	O
expression	O
looked	O
different.	O

One	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
touch	O
of	O
cruelty	O
in	O
the	O
mouth.	O

It	O
was	O
certainly	O
strange.	O

He	O
turned	O
round	O
and	O
,	O
walking	O
to	O
the	O
window	O
,	O
drew	O
up	O
the	O
blind.	O

The	O
bright	O
dawn	O
flooded	O
the	O
room	O
and	O
swept	O
the	O
fantastic	O
shadows	O
into	O
dusky	O
corners	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
lay	O
shuddering.	O

But	O
the	O
strange	O
expression	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
noticed	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
portrait	O
seemed	O
to	O
linger	O
there	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
intensified	O
even.	O

The	O
quivering	O
ardent	O
sunlight	O
showed	O
him	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
cruelty	O
round	O
the	O
mouth	O
as	O
clearly	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
looking	O
into	O

done	O

winced	O

up	O

oval	O

Cupids	O

glanced	O
hurriedly	O
into	O
its	O
polished	O
depths.	O

No	O
line	O
like	O
that	O
warped	O
his	O
red	O
lips.	O

What	O
did	O
it	O
mean	O
?	O

He	O
rubbed	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
picture	O
,	O
and	O
examined	O
it	O
again.	O

There	O
were	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
any	O
change	O
when	O
he	O
looked	O
into	O
the	O
actual	O
painting	O

and	O
yet	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
expression	O
had	O
altered.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
mere	O
fancy	O
of	O
his	O
own.	O

The	O
thing	O
was	O
horribly	O
apparent.	O

He	O
threw	O
himself	O
into	O
a	O
chair	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
think.	O

Suddenly	O
there	O
flashed	O
across	O
his	O
mind	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
said	O
in	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
s	O
studio	O
the	O
day	O
the	O
picture	O
had	O
been	O
finished.	O

Yes	O
,	O
he	O
remembered	O
it	O
perfectly.	O

He	O
had	O
uttered	O
a	O
mad	O
wish	O
that	O
he	O
himself	O
might	O
remain	O
young	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
portrait	O
grow	O
old	O
;	O
that	O
his	O
own	O
beauty	O
might	O
be	O
untarnished	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
face	O
on	O
the	O
canvas	O
bear	O
the	O
burden	O
of	O
his	O
passions	O
and	O
his	O
sins	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
painted	O
image	O
might	O
be	O
seared	O
with	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
suffering	O

thought	O

and	O
that	O

all	O
the	O
delicate	O
bloom	O

of	O

Surely	O
his	O
wish	O

?	O

Such	O
things	O
were	O
impossible.	O

It	O
seemed	O
monstrous	O
even	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
them.	O

And	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
picture	O
before	O
him	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
touch	O
of	O
cruelty	O
in	O
the	O
mouth.	O

Cruelty	O
!	O

Had	O
he	O
been	O
cruel	O
?	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
girl	O
s	O
fault	O

not	O
his.	O

He	O
had	O
dreamed	O
of	O
her	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
artist	O
,	O
had	O
given	O
his	O
love	O
to	O
her	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
thought	O
her	O
great.	O

Then	O
she	O
had	O
disappointed	O
him.	O

She	O
had	O
been	O
shallow	O
and	O
unworthy.	O

And	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
a	O
feeling	O
of	O
infinite	O
regret	O
came	O
over	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
thought	O
of	O
her	O
lying	O
at	O
his	O
feet	O
sobbing	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
child.	O

He	O
remembered	O
with	O
what	O
callousness	O
he	O
had	O
watched	O
her.	O

Why	O
had	O
he	O
been	O
made	O
like	O
that	O
?	O

Why	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
soul	O
been	O
given	O
to	O
him	O
?	O

But	O
he	O
had	O
suffered	O
also.	O

During	O
the	O
three	O
terrible	O
hours	O
that	O
the	O
play	O
had	O
lasted	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
lived	O
centuries	O
of	O
pain	O
,	O
aeon	O
upon	O
aeon	O
of	O
torture.	O

His	O
life	O
was	O
well	O
worth	O
hers.	O

She	O
had	O
marred	O
him	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
wounded	O
her	O
for	O
an	O
age.	O

Besides	O
,	O
women	O
were	O
better	O
suited	O
to	O
bear	O
sorrow	O
than	O
men.	O

They	O
lived	O
on	O
their	O
emotions.	O

They	O
only	O
thought	O
of	O
their	O
emotions.	O

When	O
they	O
took	O
lovers	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
merely	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
one	O
with	O
whom	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
scenes.	O

Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
knew	O
what	O
women	O
were.	O

Why	O
should	O
he	O
trouble	O
about	O
Sibyl	O
Vane	O
?	O

She	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
him	O
now.	O

But	O
the	O
picture	O
?	O

What	O
was	O
he	O
to	O
say	O
of	O
that	O
?	O

It	O
held	O
the	O
secret	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
his	O
story.	O

It	O
had	O
taught	O
him	O
to	O
love	O
his	O
own	O
beauty.	O

Would	O
it	O
teach	O
him	O
to	O
loathe	O
his	O
own	O
soul	O
?	O

Would	O
he	O
ever	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
again	O
?	O

No	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
merely	O
an	O
illusion	O
wrought	O
on	O
the	O
troubled	O
senses.	O

The	O
horrible	O
night	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
passed	O
had	O
left	O
phantoms	O
behind	O
it.	O

Suddenly	O
there	O
had	O
fallen	O
upon	O
his	O
brain	O
that	O
tiny	O
scarlet	O
speck	O
that	O
makes	O
men	O
mad.	O

The	O
picture	O
had	O
not	O
changed.	O

It	O
was	O
folly	O
to	O
think	O
so.	O

Yet	O
it	O
was	O
watching	O
him	O
,	O
with	O
its	O
beautiful	O
marred	O
face	O
and	O
its	O
cruel	O
smile.	O

Its	O
bright	O
hair	O
gleamed	O
in	O
the	O
early	O
sunlight.	O

Its	O
blue	O
eyes	O
met	O
his	O

A	O

of	O
infinite	O
pity	O

not	O
for	O

but	O
for	O
the	O

It	O
had	O
altered	O

and	O
would	O

Its	O
gold	O
would	O
wither	O
into	O

Its	O
red	O

roses	O
would	O
die.	O

For	O
every	O
sin	O
that	O
he	O
committed	O
,	O
a	O
stain	O
would	O
fleck	O
and	O
wreck	O
its	O

But	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
sin.	O

The	O
picture	O
,	O
changed	O
or	O
unchanged	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
visible	O

He	O
would	O

He	O

garden	O
had	O
first	O
stirred	O
within	O
him	O
the	O

Yes	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
his	O

to	O
do	O
so.	O

She	O
must	O
have	O
suffered	O
more	O
than	O

CHAPTER	O
VIII.	O

It	O
was	O
long	O
past	O
noon	O
when	O
he	O
awoke.	O

His	O
valet	O
had	O
crept	O
several	O

up	O

from	O

and	O
had	O

brought	O
by	O

that	O
morning.	O

He	O
hesitated	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O

and	O
then	O
put	O
it	O
aside.	O

The	O

every	O
morning	O
during	O

was	O
a	O
rather	O
heavy	O

for	O
a	O
chased	O
silver	O
Louis-Quinze	O
toilet-set	O
that	O

had	O
the	O
courage	O
to	O
send	O
on	O
to	O
his	O

who	O
were	O
extremely	O

did	O

when	O

there	O
were	O
several	O
very	O

offering	O

him	O

He	O
seemed	O
to	O

A	O
dim	O

some	O
strange	O

came	O
to	O
him	O
once	O

there	O
was	O
the	O
unreality	O
of	O
a	O
dream	O
about	O
it.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
was	O

he	O
went	O
into	O
the	O

It	O
was	O
not	O

make	O
reparation	O
for	O
that.	O

She	O
could	O
still	O
be	O
his	O

His	O
unreal	O
and	O
selfish	O
love	O
would	O
yield	O
to	O
some	O
higher	O

the	O

what	O

There	O
were	O
opiates	O
for	O
remorse	O
,	O
drugs	O
that	O
could	O
lull	O
the	O
moral	O
sense	O
to	O
sleep.	O

But	O
here	O
was	O
a	O
visible	O
symbol	O
of	O
the	O
degradation	O
of	O
sin.	O

Here	O
was	O
an	O
ever-present	O
sign	O
of	O
the	O
ruin	O
men	O
brought	O
upon	O
their	O
souls.	O

Three	O
o	O
clock	O

,	O
and	O
four	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
half-hour	O
rang	O
its	O

,	O
but	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
did	O
not	O
stir.	O

He	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
gather	O
up	O
the	O
scarlet	O
threads	O
of	O
life	O
and	O
to	O
weave	O
them	O
into	O
a	O
pattern	O
;	O
to	O
find	O
his	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
sanguine	O
labyrinth	O
of	O
passion	O
through	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
wandering.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
to	O
think.	O

Finally	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
table	O
and	O
wrote	O
a	O
passionate	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
girl	O
he	O
had	O
loved	O
,	O
imploring	O
her	O
forgiveness	O
and	O
accusing	O
himself	O
of	O
madness.	O

He	O
covered	O
page	O
after	O
page	O
with	O
wild	O
words	O
of	O
sorrow	O
and	O
wilder	O
words	O
of	O
pain.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
luxury	O
in	O
self-reproach.	O

When	O
we	O
blame	O
ourselves	O
,	O
we	O
feel	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
else	O
has	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
blame	O
us.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
confession	O
,	O
not	O
the	O
priest	O
,	O
that	O
gives	O
us	O
absolution.	O

When	O
Dorian	O
had	O
finished	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
he	O
felt	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
forgiven.	O

Suddenly	O
there	O
came	O
a	O
knock	O
to	O
the	O
door	O

and	O
he	O
heard	O

way	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
public.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
seems	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
leaving	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
theatre	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
mother	I-QUOTE

about	I-QUOTE
half-past	I-QUOTE
twelve	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
forgotten	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
upstairs.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
waited	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
ultimately	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
lying	I-QUOTE
dead	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
floor	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
dressing-room.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
swallowed	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
mistake	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
dreadful	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
use	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
theatres.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
either	I-QUOTE
prussic	I-QUOTE

white	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

fancy	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
prussic	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
_The	I-QUOTE
Standard_	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
seventeen.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
younger	I-QUOTE

that.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
looked	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
child	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE

little	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE

Dorian	I-QUOTE

mustn	I-QUOTE

let	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
get	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE

dine	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
afterwards	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE
Patti	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE

everybody	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
there.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
sister	I-QUOTE

to-night	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
dine	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE

then	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

sup	I-QUOTE
somewhere	I-QUOTE

afterwards.	I-QUOTE

How	I-QUOTE
extraordinarily	I-QUOTE
dramatic	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
wept	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

Somehow	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
happened	I-QUOTE
actually	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
seems	I-QUOTE
far	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
wonderful	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
tears.	I-QUOTE

Here	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
passionate	I-QUOTE
love-letter	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
written	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

Strange	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
passionate	I-QUOTE
love-letter	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
addressed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
dead	I-QUOTE
girl.	I-QUOTE

Can	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
feel	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
those	I-QUOTE
white	I-QUOTE
silent	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
call	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dead	I-QUOTE

Can	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
feel	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
listen	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

Oh	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
loved	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
seems	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
ago	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
now.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

Then	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
dreadful	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
last	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

when	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
played	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
badly	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
heart	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
broke.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
explained	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
terribly	I-QUOTE
pathetic.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
moved	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
bit.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
shallow.	I-QUOTE

Suddenly	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
happened	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
afraid.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
terrible.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
back	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
wrong.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
dead.	I-QUOTE

My	I-QUOTE
God	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

My	I-QUOTE
God	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
shall	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
danger	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
keep	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
straight.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
right	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
kill	I-QUOTE
herself.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
selfish	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

you	I-QUOTE

Of	I-QUOTE

you	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE

treated	I-QUOTE

be	I-QUOTE
kind	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
whom	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
cares	I-QUOTE
nothing.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE

soon	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE

force	I-QUOTE

sense	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
dramatic	I-QUOTE
effect.	I-QUOTE

Suddenly	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
longer	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
actors	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
spectators	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play.	I-QUOTE

Or	I-QUOTE
rather	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
both.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
watch	I-QUOTE
ourselves	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
mere	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
spectacle	I-QUOTE
enthralls	I-QUOTE
us.	I-QUOTE

In	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
present	I-QUOTE
case	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
happened	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

Some	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
killed	I-QUOTE
herself	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
wish	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
experience.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
rest	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
adored	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
many	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
insisted	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
living	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
long	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
ceased	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
care	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
care	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
become	I-QUOTE
stout	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
tedious	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
meet	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
reminiscences.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
awful	I-QUOTE
memory	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
woman	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
fearful	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
utter	I-QUOTE
intellectual	I-QUOTE
stagnation	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
reveals	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

One	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
absorb	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
colour	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
remember	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
details.	I-QUOTE

Details	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
vulgar.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
I	B-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
sow	I-QUOTE
poppies	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
garden	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
"	O
sighed	O
Dorian.	O

"	O
There	B-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
necessity	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
"	O

his	O
companion.	O

"	O
Life	B-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
poppies	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
hands.	I-QUOTE

Of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
then	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
linger.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
wore	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
violets	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
through	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
season	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
form	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
artistic	I-QUOTE
mourning	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
romance	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
die.	I-QUOTE

Ultimately	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
however	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
die.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
forget	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
killed	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
proposing	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
sacrifice	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
whole	I-QUOTE
world	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
dreadful	I-QUOTE
moment.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
fills	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
terror	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
eternity.	I-QUOTE

Well	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
believe	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE
week	I-QUOTE
ago	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Hampshire	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
myself	I-QUOTE
seated	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
dinner	I-QUOTE
next	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
lady	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
question	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
insisted	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
whole	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
again	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
digging	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
past	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
raking	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
future.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
buried	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
romance	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
bed	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
asphodel.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
dragged	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
again	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
assured	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
spoiled	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
bound	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
state	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
ate	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
enormous	I-QUOTE
dinner	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
feel	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
anxiety.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
lack	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
taste	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
showed	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
charm	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
past	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
past.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
curtain	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
fallen.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
want	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sixth	I-QUOTE
act	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
soon	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
interest	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
propose	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
continue	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

If	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
allowed	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
comedy	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
tragic	I-QUOTE
ending	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
tragedy	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
culminate	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
farce.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
charmingly	I-QUOTE
artificial	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
sense	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
art.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
fortunate	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
am.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
assure	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
known	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
Sibyl	I-QUOTE
Vane	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

Ordinary	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
console	I-QUOTE
themselves.	I-QUOTE

Some	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
sentimental	I-QUOTE
colours.	I-QUOTE

Never	I-QUOTE
trust	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
woman	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
wears	I-QUOTE
mauve	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
whatever	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
age	I-QUOTE
may	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
woman	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
thirty-five	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
fond	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
pink	I-QUOTE
ribbons.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
means	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
history.	I-QUOTE

Others	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
consolation	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
suddenly	I-QUOTE
discovering	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
qualities	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
husbands.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
flaunt	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
conjugal	I-QUOTE
felicity	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
fascinating	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
sins.	I-QUOTE

Religion	I-QUOTE
consoles	I-QUOTE
some.	I-QUOTE

Its	I-QUOTE
mysteries	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
charm	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
flirtation	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
woman	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
understand	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

Besides	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
makes	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
vain	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sinner.	I-QUOTE

Conscience	I-QUOTE
makes	I-QUOTE
egotists	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
all.	I-QUOTE

Yes	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
end	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
consolations	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
modern	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

Indeed	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
mentioned	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
important	I-QUOTE
one.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
What	B-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

"	O
said	O
the	O
lad	O
listlessly.	O

"	O
Oh	B-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
obvious	I-QUOTE
consolation.	I-QUOTE

Taking	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
else	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
admirer	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
loses	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
own.	I-QUOTE

In	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
society	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
whitewashes	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
woman.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
different	I-QUOTE
Sibyl	I-QUOTE
Vane	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
meets	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
beautiful	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
death.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
glad	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
living	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
century	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
wonders	I-QUOTE
happen.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
make	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
believe	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
reality	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
romance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
love.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
I	B-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
terribly	I-QUOTE
cruel	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
forget	I-QUOTE
that.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
I	B-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
afraid	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
appreciate	I-QUOTE
cruelty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
downright	I-QUOTE
cruelty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
anything	I-QUOTE
else.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
wonderfully	I-QUOTE
primitive	I-QUOTE
instincts.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
emancipated	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
remain	I-QUOTE
slaves	I-QUOTE
looking	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
masters	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
same.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
dominated.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
sure	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
splendid.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
absolutely	I-QUOTE
angry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
fancy	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
delightful	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
looked.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
day	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
yesterday	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE

be	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
fanciful	I-QUOTE

but	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
absolutely	I-QUOTE
true	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
holds	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
key	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
everything.	I-QUOTE

"	O

What	B-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
You	B-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
Sibyl	I-QUOTE
Vane	I-QUOTE
represented	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
heroines	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
romance	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE

one	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
Ophelia	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

that	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
played	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
last	I-QUOTE
part.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
lonely	I-QUOTE
death	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
tawdry	I-QUOTE
dressing-room	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE

some	I-QUOTE
Jacobean	I-QUOTE
tragedy	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE
wonderful	I-QUOTE

from	I-QUOTE
Webster	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
girl	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE

lived	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
died.	I-QUOTE

To	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
dream	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
phantom	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
flitted	I-QUOTE
through	I-QUOTE
Shakespeare	I-QUOTE

left	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
lovelier	I-QUOTE

sounded	I-QUOTE
richer	I-QUOTE

more	I-QUOTE
full	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
joy.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
moment	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
touched	I-QUOTE
actual	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE

she	I-QUOTE
marred	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE

it	I-QUOTE
marred	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE

so	I-QUOTE

go	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE

For	I-QUOTE

lived	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
finest	I-QUOTE
tragedy.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE
heroine.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
last	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE

played	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
saw	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE

acted	I-QUOTE
badly	I-QUOTE

had	I-QUOTE
known	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
reality	I-QUOTE

love.	I-QUOTE

When	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
knew	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
unreality	I-QUOTE

she	I-QUOTE
died	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
Juliet	I-QUOTE
might	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
died.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
passed	I-QUOTE
again	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
sphere	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
art.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
martyr	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

Her	I-QUOTE
death	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
pathetic	I-QUOTE
uselessness	I-QUOTE

martyrdom	I-QUOTE

all	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
wasted	I-QUOTE
beauty.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
saying	I-QUOTE

you	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
suffered.	I-QUOTE

If	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE

,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
quarter	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
six	I-QUOTE

would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE

tears.	I-QUOTE

Even	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE

was	I-QUOTE
here	I-QUOTE

brought	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE

had	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
idea	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
through.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
suffered	I-QUOTE
immensely.	I-QUOTE

Then	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
passed	I-QUOTE
away.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
repeat	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
emotion.	I-QUOTE

No	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE

except	I-QUOTE
sentimentalists.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
awfully	I-QUOTE
unjust	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE
here	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
console	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
charming	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
consoled	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
furious.	I-QUOTE

How	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sympathetic	I-QUOTE
person	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
remind	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
story	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
certain	I-QUOTE
philanthropist	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
spent	I-QUOTE
twenty	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
trying	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
get	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
grievance	I-QUOTE
redressed	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
unjust	I-QUOTE
law	I-QUOTE
altered	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
forget	I-QUOTE
exactly	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was.	I-QUOTE

Finally	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
succeeded	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
exceed	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
disappointment.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
absolutely	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
died	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
_ennui_	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
became	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
confirmed	I-QUOTE
misanthrope.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
besides	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
dear	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
Basil	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
want	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
console	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
teach	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
rather	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
forget	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
happened	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
proper	I-QUOTE
artistic	I-QUOTE
point	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
view.	I-QUOTE

Was	I-QUOTE

write	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE

went	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
grew	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
absorbed	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

Then	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
new	I-QUOTE
development.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
drawn	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
Paris	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
dainty	I-QUOTE
armour	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
Adonis	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
huntsman	I-QUOTE

cloak	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
polished	I-QUOTE
boar-spear.	I-QUOTE

Crowned	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
heavy	I-QUOTE
lotus-blossoms	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
sat	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
prow	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Adrian	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
barge	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
gazing	I-QUOTE
across	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
green	I-QUOTE
turbid	I-QUOTE
Nile.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
leaned	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
still	I-QUOTE
pool	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
Greek	I-QUOTE
woodland	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
water	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
silent	I-QUOTE
silver	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
marvel	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
face.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
art	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
unconscious	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
ideal	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
remote.	I-QUOTE

One	I-QUOTE
day	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
fatal	I-QUOTE
day	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
sometimes	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
paint	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
wonderful	I-QUOTE
portrait	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
actually	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
costume	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
dead	I-QUOTE
ages	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
dress	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
time.	I-QUOTE

Whether	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
realism	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
method	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
mere	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
personality	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
thus	I-QUOTE
directly	I-QUOTE
presented	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
without	I-QUOTE
mist	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
veil	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
tell.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
worked	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
flake	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
film	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
colour	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
reveal	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
secret.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
grew	I-QUOTE
afraid	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
others	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
idolatry.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
put	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
myself	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

Then	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
resolved	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
allow	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
picture	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
exhibited.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
annoyed	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
then	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
realize	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
meant	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
whom	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
talked	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
laughed	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
mind	I-QUOTE
that.	I-QUOTE

When	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
picture	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
finished	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
sat	I-QUOTE
alone	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
right	I-QUOTE
...	I-QUOTE

.	I-QUOTE

Well	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
few	I-QUOTE
days	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
left	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
studio	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
soon	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
got	I-QUOTE
rid	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
intolerable	I-QUOTE
fascination	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
presence	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
foolish	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
imagining	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
anything	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
extremely	I-QUOTE
good-looking	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
paint.	I-QUOTE

Even	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
help	I-QUOTE
feeling	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
mistake	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
feels	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
creation	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
shown	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
work	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
creates.	I-QUOTE

Art	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
abstract	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
fancy.	I-QUOTE

Form	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
colour	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
form	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
colour	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
all.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
often	I-QUOTE
seems	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
art	I-QUOTE
conceals	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
artist	I-QUOTE
far	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
completely	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
reveals	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
got	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
offer	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
Paris	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
make	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
portrait	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
principal	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
exhibition.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
occurred	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
refuse.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
right.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
picture	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
shown.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
angry	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE

at	O

steadfastly	O

wondered	O

The	O
man	O

quite	O

waited	O
for	O

orders.	O

lit	O
a	O
cigarette	O
and	O
walked	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
glass	O
and	O
glanced	O
into	O
it.	O

He	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
reflection	O
of	O
Victor	O

face	O
perfectly.	O

It	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
placid	O
mask	O
of	O
servility.	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
afraid	O
of	O
,	O
there.	O

Yet	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
best	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
his	O
guard.	O

Speaking	O
very	O
slowly	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
him	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
house-keeper	O

had	O
perhaps	O

often	O
as	O
a	O
pall	O
for	O

a	O
corruption	O

And	O
Mr.	O
Hubbard	O
tramped	O
downstairs	O
,	O
followed	O
by	O
the	O
assistant	O
,	O
who	O
glanced	O
back	O
at	O
Dorian	O
with	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
shy	O
wonder	O
in	O
his	O
rough	O
uncomely	O
face.	O

He	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
any	O
one	O
so	O

When	O
the	O

away	O
,	O
Dorian	O
locked	O
the	O
door	O
and	O
put	O
the	O
key	O
in	O
his	O
pocket.	O

He	O
felt	O

now.	O

No	O

No	O

his	O
would	O

see	O
his	O
shame.	O

On	O
reaching	O
the	O
library	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
after	O
five	O
o	O
clock	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
tea	O
had	O

was	O
lying	O
a	O

beside	O

a	O

bound	O
in	O
yellow	O
paper	O

the	O
cover	O
slightly	O

A	O
copy	O
of	O
the	O
third	O
edition	O
of	O
_The	O
St.	O

James	O
s	O
Gazette_	O
had	O
been	O
placed	O
on	O
the	O
tea-tray.	O

It	O
was	O
evident	O
that	O
Victor	O
had	O
returned.	O

He	O
wondered	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
met	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
hall	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
leaving	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
had	O
wormed	O
out	O
of	O
them	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
doing.	O

He	O
would	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
miss	O
the	O
picture	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
missed	O
it	O
already	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
laying	O
the	O
tea-things.	O

The	O
screen	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
set	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
blank	O
space	O
was	O
visible	O
on	O
the	O
wall.	O

Perhaps	O
some	O
night	O
he	O
might	O
find	O
him	O
creeping	O
upstairs	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
force	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
the	O
room.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
horrible	O
thing	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
spy	O
in	O
one	O
s	O
house.	O

He	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
rich	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
blackmailed	O
all	O
their	O
lives	O
by	O
some	O
servant	O
who	O
had	O
read	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
or	O
overheard	O
a	O
conversation	O
,	O
or	O
picked	O
up	O
a	O
card	O
with	O
an	O
address	O
,	O
or	O
found	O
beneath	O
a	O
pillow	O
a	O
withered	O
flower	O
or	O
a	O
shred	O
of	O
crumpled	O
lace.	O

He	O
sighed	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
poured	O
himself	O
out	O
some	O
tea	O
,	O
opened	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
s	O
note.	O

It	O
was	O
simply	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
sent	O
him	O
round	O
the	O
evening	O
paper	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
book	O
that	O
might	O
interest	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
club	O
at	O
eight-fifteen.	O

He	O
opened	O
_The	O
St.	O

James	O
s_	O
languidly	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
through	O
it.	O

A	O
red	O
pencil-mark	O
on	O
the	O
fifth	O
page	O
caught	O
his	O
eye.	O

It	O
drew	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
following	O
paragraph	O
:	O
INQUEST	O
ON	O
AN	O
ACTRESS.	O

An	O
inquest	O
was	O
held	O
this	O
morning	O
at	O
the	O
Bell	O
Tavern	O
,	O
Hoxton	O
Road	O
,	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Danby	O
,	O
the	O
District	O
Coroner	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
Sibyl	O
Vane	O
,	O
a	O
young	O
actress	O
recently	O
engaged	O
at	O
the	O
Royal	O
Theatre	O
,	O
Holborn.	O

A	O
verdict	O
of	O
death	O
by	O
misadventure	O
was	O
returned.	O

Considerable	O
sympathy	O
was	O
expressed	O
for	O
the	O
mother	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
greatly	O
affected	O
during	O
the	O
giving	O
of	O
her	O
own	O
evidence	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
of	O
Dr.	O
Birrell	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
post-mortem	O
examination	O
of	O
the	O
deceased.	O

He	O
frowned	O
,	O
and	O
tearing	O
the	O
paper	O
in	O
two	O
,	O
went	O
across	O
the	O
room	O
and	O
flung	O
the	O
pieces	O
away.	O

How	O
ugly	O
it	O
all	O
was	O
!	O

And	O
how	O
horribly	O
real	O
ugliness	O
made	O
things	O
!	O

He	O
felt	O
a	O
little	O
annoyed	O
with	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
for	O
having	O
sent	O
him	O
the	O
report.	O

And	O
it	O
was	O
certainly	O
stupid	O
of	O
him	O
to	O
have	O
marked	O
it	O
with	O
red	O
pencil.	O

Victor	O
might	O
have	O
read	O
it.	O

The	O
man	O
knew	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
English	O
for	O
that.	O

Perhaps	O
he	O
had	O
read	O
it	O
and	O
had	O
begun	O
to	O
suspect	O
something.	O

And	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
what	O
did	O
it	O
matter	O
?	O

What	O
had	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
Sibyl	O
Vane	O
s	O
death	O
?	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
fear.	O

Dorian	O
Gray	O
had	O
not	O
killed	O
her.	O

His	O
eye	O
fell	O
on	O
the	O
yellow	O
book	O
that	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
sent	O
him.	O

What	O
was	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
wondered.	O

He	O
went	O
towards	O
the	O
little	O
,	O
pearl-coloured	O
octagonal	O
stand	O
that	O
had	O
always	O
looked	O
to	O
him	O
like	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
some	O
strange	O
Egyptian	O
bees	O
that	O
wrought	O
in	O
silver	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
up	O
the	O
volume	O
,	O
flung	O
himself	O
into	O
an	O
arm-chair	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
turn	O
over	O
the	O
leaves.	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
he	O
became	O
absorbed.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
strangest	O
book	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
ever	O
read.	O

It	O
seemed	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
in	O
exquisite	O
raiment	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
delicate	O
sound	O
of	O
flutes	O
,	O
the	O
sins	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
were	O
passing	O
in	O
dumb	O
show	O
before	O
him.	O

Things	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
dimly	O
dreamed	O
of	O
were	O
suddenly	O
made	O
real	O
to	O
him.	O

Things	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
dreamed	O
were	O
gradually	O
revealed.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
novel	O
without	O
a	O
plot	O
and	O
with	O
only	O
one	O
character	O
,	O
being	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
simply	O
a	O
psychological	O
study	O
of	O
a	O
certain	O
young	O
Parisian	O
who	O
spent	O
his	O
life	O
trying	O
to	O
realize	O
in	O
the	O
nineteenth	O
century	O
all	O
the	O
passions	O
and	O
modes	O
of	O
thought	O
that	O
belonged	O
to	O
every	O
century	O
except	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
sum	O
up	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
himself	O
the	O
various	O
moods	O
through	O
which	O
the	O
world-spirit	O
had	O
ever	O
passed	O
,	O
loving	O
for	O
their	O
mere	O
artificiality	O
those	O
renunciations	O
that	O
men	O
have	O
unwisely	O
called	O
virtue	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
those	O
natural	O
rebellions	O
that	O
wise	O
men	O
still	O
call	O
sin.	O

The	O
style	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
written	O
was	O
that	O
curious	O
jewelled	O
style	O
,	O
vivid	O
and	O
obscure	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
_argot_	O
and	O
of	O
archaisms	O
,	O
of	O
technical	O
expressions	O
and	O
of	O
elaborate	O
paraphrases	O
,	O
that	O
characterizes	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
finest	O
artists	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
school	O
of	O
_Symbolistes_.	O

There	O
were	O
in	O
it	O
metaphors	O
as	O
monstrous	O
as	O
orchids	O
and	O
as	O
subtle	O
in	O
colour.	O

The	O
life	O
of	O
the	O
senses	O
was	O
described	O
in	O
the	O
terms	O
of	O
mystical	O
philosophy.	O

One	O
hardly	O
knew	O
at	O
times	O
whether	O
one	O
was	O
reading	O
the	O
spiritual	O
ecstasies	O
of	O
some	O
medi	O
val	O
saint	O
or	O
the	O
morbid	O
confessions	O
of	O
a	O
modern	O
sinner.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
poisonous	O
book.	O

The	O
heavy	O
odour	O
of	O
incense	O
seemed	O
to	O
cling	O
about	O
its	O
pages	O
and	O
to	O
trouble	O
the	O
brain.	O

The	O
mere	O
cadence	O
of	O
the	O
sentences	O
,	O
the	O
subtle	O
monotony	O
of	O
their	O
music	O
,	O
so	O
full	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
complex	O
refrains	O
and	O
movements	O
elaborately	O
repeated	O
,	O
produced	O
in	O
the	O
mind	O
of	O
the	O
lad	O

he	O
passed	O
from	O
chapter	O

chapter	O
,	O
a	O
form	O
of	O
reverie	O
,	O
a	O
malady	O

that	O

him	O

of	O
the	O

CHAPTER	O
XI.	O

For	O
years	O
,	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
could	O
not	O
free	O
himself	O
from	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
this	O
book.	O

Or	O
perhaps	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
accurate	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
never	O
sought	O
to	O
free	O
himself	O
from	O
it.	O

He	O
procured	O
from	O
Paris	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
nine	O
large-paper	O
copies	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
edition	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
them	O
bound	O
in	O
different	O
colours	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
suit	O
his	O
various	O
moods	O
and	O
the	O
changing	O
fancies	O
of	O
a	O
nature	O
over	O
which	O
he	O
seemed	O
,	O
at	O
times	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
almost	O
entirely	O
lost	O
control.	O

The	O
hero	O
,	O
the	O
wonderful	O
young	O
Parisian	O
in	O
whom	O
the	O
romantic	O
and	O
the	O
scientific	O
temperaments	O
were	O
so	O
strangely	O
blended	O
,	O
became	O
to	O
him	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
prefiguring	O
type	O
of	O
himself.	O

And	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
book	O
seemed	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
contain	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
life	O
,	O
written	O
before	O
he	O
had	O
lived	O
it.	O

In	O
one	O
point	O
he	O
was	O
more	O
fortunate	O
than	O
the	O
novel	O
s	O
fantastic	O
hero.	O

He	O
never	O
knew	O
never	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
had	O
any	O
cause	O
to	O

that	O
somewhat	O

dread	O
of	O
mirrors	O

and	O
polished	O
metal	O

which	O
came	O

the	O
young	O
Parisian	O
so	O
early	O
in	O

with	O

the	O

the	O
book	O

with	O
its	O
really	O
tragic	O

if	O
somewhat	O
overemphasized	O

account	O
of	O
the	O
sorrow	O

of	O

in	O

and	O
the	O

he	O
had	O
most	O

For	O
the	O

beauty	O
that	O
had	O
so	O
fascinated	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
others	O
besides	O
him	O

seemed	O
never	O
to	O

him.	O

Even	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
heard	O
the	O
most	O
evil	O
things	O
against	O
him	O
and	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
strange	O
rumours	O
about	O
his	O
mode	O
of	O
life	O
crept	O
through	O
London	O
and	O
became	O
the	O
chatter	O
of	O
the	O
clubs	O
could	O
not	O
believe	O
anything	O
to	O
his	O
dishonour	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
him.	O

He	O
had	O
always	O
the	O
look	O
of	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
kept	O
himself	O
unspotted	O
from	O
the	O
world.	O

Men	O
who	O
talked	O
grossly	O
became	O
silent	O
when	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
entered	O
the	O
room.	O

There	O
was	O
something	O
in	O
the	O
purity	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
that	O
rebuked	O
them.	O

His	O
mere	O
presence	O
seemed	O
to	O
recall	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
memory	O
of	O
the	O
innocence	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
tarnished.	O

They	O
wondered	O
how	O
one	O
so	O
charming	O
and	O
graceful	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
could	O
have	O
escaped	O
the	O
stain	O
of	O
an	O
age	O
that	O
was	O
at	O
once	O
sordid	O
and	O
sensual.	O

Often	O
,	O
on	O
returning	O
home	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
mysterious	O
and	O
prolonged	O
absences	O
that	O
gave	O
rise	O
to	O
such	O
strange	O
conjecture	O
among	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
his	O
friends	O
,	O
or	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
,	O
he	O
himself	O
would	O
creep	O
upstairs	O
to	O
the	O
locked	O
room	O
,	O
open	O
the	O
door	O
with	O
the	O
key	O
that	O
never	O
left	O
him	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
stand	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
mirror	O
,	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
portrait	O
that	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
had	O
painted	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
looking	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
evil	O
and	O
aging	O
face	O
on	O
the	O
canvas	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
fair	O
young	O
face	O
that	O
laughed	O
back	O
at	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
polished	O
glass.	O

The	O
very	O
sharpness	O
of	O
the	O
contrast	O
used	O
to	O
quicken	O
his	O
sense	O
of	O
pleasure.	O

He	O
grew	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
enamoured	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
beauty	O
,	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
interested	O
in	O
the	O
corruption	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
soul.	O

He	O
would	O
examine	O
with	O
minute	O
care	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
with	O
a	O
monstrous	O
and	O
terrible	O
delight	O
,	O
the	O
hideous	O
lines	O
that	O
seared	O
the	O
wrinkling	O
forehead	O
or	O
crawled	O
around	O
the	O
heavy	O
sensual	O
mouth	O
,	O
wondering	O
sometimes	O
which	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
horrible	O
,	O
the	O
signs	O
of	O
sin	O
or	O
the	O
signs	O
of	O
age.	O

He	O
would	O
place	O
his	O
white	O
hands	O
beside	O
the	O
coarse	O
bloated	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
picture	O
,	O
and	O
smile.	O

He	O
mocked	O
the	O
misshapen	O
body	O
and	O
the	O
failing	O
limbs.	O

There	O
were	O
moments	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
lying	O
sleepless	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
delicately	O
scented	O
chamber	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
sordid	O
room	O
of	O
the	O
little	O
ill-famed	O
tavern	O
near	O
the	O
docks	O
which	O
,	O
under	O
an	O
assumed	O
name	O
and	O
in	O
disguise	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
habit	O
to	O
frequent	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
ruin	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
upon	O
his	O
soul	O
with	O
a	O
pity	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
the	O
more	O
poignant	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
purely	O
selfish.	O

But	O
moments	O
such	O
as	O
these	O
were	O
rare.	O

That	O
curiosity	O
about	O
life	O
which	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
first	O
stirred	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
sat	O
together	O
in	O
the	O
garden	O
of	O
their	O
friend	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
increase	O
with	O
gratification.	O

The	O
more	O
he	O
knew	O
,	O
the	O
more	O
he	O
desired	O
to	O
know.	O

He	O
had	O
mad	O
hungers	O
that	O
grew	O
more	O
ravenous	O
as	O
he	O
fed	O
them.	O

Yet	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
really	O
reckless	O
,	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
in	O
his	O
relations	O
to	O
society.	O

Once	O
or	O
twice	O
every	O
month	O
during	O
the	O
winter	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
each	O
Wednesday	O
evening	O
while	O
the	O
season	O
lasted	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
throw	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
world	O
his	O
beautiful	O
house	O
and	O
have	O
the	O
most	O
celebrated	O
musicians	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
to	O
charm	O
his	O
guests	O
with	O
the	O
wonders	O
of	O
their	O
art.	O

His	O
little	O
dinners	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
settling	O
of	O
which	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
always	O
assisted	O
him	O
,	O
were	O
noted	O
as	O
much	O
for	O
the	O
careful	O
selection	O
and	O
placing	O
of	O
those	O
invited	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
exquisite	O
taste	O
shown	O
in	O
the	O
decoration	O
of	O
the	O

with	O
its	O

Indeed	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
,	O
especially	O
among	O
the	O
very	O
young	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
saw	O
,	O
or	O
fancied	O
that	O
they	O
saw	O

in	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
the	O
true	O
realization	O
of	O
a	O
type	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
often	O
dreamed	O
in	O
Eton	O
or	O
Oxford	O
days	O
,	O
a	O
type	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
combine	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
real	O
culture	O
of	O
the	O
scholar	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
grace	O
and	O
distinction	O
and	O
perfect	O
manner	O
of	O
a	O
citizen	O
of	O
the	O
world.	O

To	O
them	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
of	O
those	O
whom	O
Dante	O
describes	O
as	O
having	O
sought	O
to	O
"	O
make	O
themselves	O
perfect	O
by	O
the	O
worship	O
of	O

"	O
Like	O

he	O
was	O
one	O
for	O
whom	O

existed.	O

"	O
And	O
,	O
certainly	O
,	O
to	O
him	O

itself	O

for	O

a	O

is	O

for	O
a	O
moment	O
universal	O
,	O
and	O
dandyism	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
its	O

way	O
,	O
is	O
an	O
attempt	O
to	O

the	O

modernity	O
of	O
beauty	O
,	O
had	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
their	O
fascination	O
for	O
him.	O

His	O
mode	O
of	O
dressing	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
particular	O
styles	O
that	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
he	O
affected	O
,	O
had	O
their	O
marked	O
influence	O
on	O
the	O
young	O
exquisites	O
of	O
the	O
Mayfair	O

Pall	O

who	O
copied	O

For	O

while	O
he	O
was	O

too	O
ready	O
to	O
accept	O
the	O
position	O
that	O
was	O
almost	O
immediately	O
offered	O
to	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
coming	O
of	O

,	O
and	O
found	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
a	O
subtle	O
pleasure	O
in	O
the	O
thought	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
really	O

to	O
the	O
London	O

what	O

of	O
the	O
Satyricon	O
once	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
yet	O
in	O
his	O
inmost	O
heart	O
he	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
something	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
mere	O
_arbiter	O
elegantiarum_	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
consulted	O
on	O
the	O
wearing	O
of	O

the	O
knotting	O
of	O
a	O
necktie	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
a	O
cane.	O

He	O
sought	O
to	O
elaborate	O
some	O
new	O
scheme	O
of	O
life	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
its	O
reasoned	O
philosophy	O
and	O
its	O
ordered	O
principles	O
,	O
and	O
find	O
in	O
the	O
spiritualizing	O
of	O
the	O
senses	O
its	O
highest	O
realization.	O

The	O
worship	O
of	O
the	O

has	O
often	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
much	O
justice	O
,	O
been	O
decried	O
,	O
men	O
feeling	O
a	O
natural	O
instinct	O
of	O
terror	O
about	O
passions	O
and	O
sensations	O
that	O
seem	O
stronger	O
than	O
themselves	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
conscious	O
of	O
sharing	O
with	O
the	O
less	O
highly	O
organized	O
forms	O
of	O
existence.	O

But	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
that	O
the	O
true	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
senses	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
understood	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
remained	O
savage	O
and	O
animal	O
merely	O
because	O
the	O
world	O
had	O
sought	O
to	O
starve	O
them	O
into	O
submission	O
or	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
by	O
pain	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
aiming	O
at	O
making	O
them	O
elements	O
of	O
a	O
new	O
spirituality	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
a	O
fine	O
instinct	O
for	O
beauty	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
dominant	O
characteristic.	O

As	O
he	O
looked	O
back	O
upon	O
man	O
moving	O
through	O
history	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
haunted	O
by	O
a	O
feeling	O
of	O
loss.	O

So	O
much	O
had	O
been	O
surrendered	O
!	O

and	O
to	O
such	O
little	O
purpose	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
mad	O
wilful	O
rejections	O

monstrous	O
forms	O
of	O
self-torture	O
and	O
self-denial	O
,	O
whose	O
origin	O
was	O
fear	O
and	O
whose	O
result	O
was	O
a	O
degradation	O
infinitely	O
more	O
terrible	O
than	O
that	O
fancied	O
degradation	O
from	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
ignorance	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
sought	O

Yes	O
:	O
there	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
as	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
prophesied	O
,	O
a	O
new	O
Hedonism	O
that	O
was	O
to	O

puritanism	O
that	O
is	O
having	O
,	O
in	O
our	O

day	O
,	O
its	O
curious	O
revival.	O

It	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
its	O
service	O
of	O
the	O
intellect	O

certainly	O

it	O
was	O
never	O
to	O

system	O
that	O
would	O
involve	O
the	O
sacrifice	O
of	O
any	O
mode	O
of	O
passionate	O
experience.	O

Its	O
aim	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
experience	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
the	O
fruits	O
of	O

sweet	O
or	O
bitter	O
as	O
they	O
might	O
be.	O

Of	O
the	O
asceticism	O
that	O
deadens	O
the	O
senses	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
the	O
vulgar	O
profligacy	O
that	O
dulls	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
know	O
nothing.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
teach	O
man	O
to	O
concentrate	O
himself	O
upon	O
the	O
moments	O
of	O
a	O
life	O
that	O

He	O

that	O

He	O
had	O
a	O
special	O
passion	O
,	O
also	O
,	O
for	O
ecclesiastical	O
vestments	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
he	O
had	O
for	O

In	O

that	O
lined	O
the	O

of	O
his	O

must	O
wear	O

by	O
the	O

that	O

He	O
possessed	O
a	O
gorgeous	O
cope	O
of	O
crimson	O
silk	O
and	O
gold-thread	O

,	O
figured	O
with	O
a	O

of	O

which	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
was	O
the	O
pine-apple	O
device	O
wrought	O
in	O
seed-pearls.	O

The	O
orphreys	O
were	O
divided	O
into	O
panels	O

scenes	O
from	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
the	O
Virgin	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
coronation	O
of	O
the	O
Virgin	O
was	O
figured	O
in	O
coloured	O
silks	O
upon	O
the	O
hood.	O

This	O
was	O
Italian	O
work	O
of	O
the	O
fifteenth	O
century.	O

Another	O
cope	O
was	O
of	O
green	O
velvet	O
,	O
embroidered	O
with	O
heart-shaped	O
groups	O
of	O
acanthus-leaves	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
spread	O
long-stemmed	O
white	O

the	O

of	O
which	O
were	O
picked	O
out	O
with	O
silver	O

The	O
morse	O
bore	O
a	O
seraph	O

head	O
in	O
gold-thread	O
raised	O
work.	O

The	O
orphreys	O
were	O
woven	O
in	O
a	O
diaper	O
of	O
red	O
and	O
gold	O
silk	O
,	O
and	O
were	O

medallions	O
of	O
many	O
saints	O

,	O
among	O
whom	O
was	O
St.	O

He	O
had	O
chasubles	O

also	O
,	O
of	O
amber-coloured	O

and	O
blue	O
silk	O

and	O
yellow	O

and	O
cloth	O
of	O

figured	O
with	O

In	O
the	O
mystic	O
offices	O
to	O
which	O
such	O
things	O
were	O
put	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
that	O
quickened	O
his	O
imagination.	O

For	O
these	O
treasures	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
that	O
he	O
collected	O
in	O
his	O
lovely	O
house	O
,	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
him	O
means	O
of	O
forgetfulness	O
,	O
modes	O
by	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
escape	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
season	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
fear	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
him	O
at	O
times	O
to	O
be	O
almost	O
too	O
great	O
to	O
be	O
borne.	O

Upon	O
the	O
walls	O
of	O
the	O
lonely	O
locked	O
room	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
spent	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
his	O
boyhood	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
hung	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
the	O
terrible	O
portrait	O
whose	O
changing	O
features	O
showed	O
him	O
the	O
real	O
degradation	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
it	O
had	O
draped	O
the	O
purple-and-gold	O
pall	O
as	O
a	O
curtain.	O

For	O
weeks	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
there	O
,	O
would	O
forget	O
the	O
hideous	O
painted	O
thing	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
back	O
his	O
light	O
heart	O
,	O
his	O
wonderful	O
joyousness	O
,	O
his	O
passionate	O
absorption	O
in	O
mere	O
existence.	O

Then	O
,	O
suddenly	O
,	O
some	O
night	O
he	O
would	O
creep	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
dreadful	O
places	O
near	O
Blue	O
Gate	O
Fields	O
,	O
and	O
stay	O
there	O
,	O
day	O
after	O
day	O
,	O
until	O
he	O
was	O
driven	O
away.	O

On	O
his	O
return	O
he	O
would	O
sit	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
picture	O
,	O
sometimes	O
loathing	O
it	O
and	O
himself	O
,	O
but	O
filled	O
,	O
at	O
other	O
times	O
,	O
with	O
that	O
pride	O
of	O
individualism	O
that	O
is	O
half	O
the	O
fascination	O
of	O
sin	O
,	O
and	O
smiling	O
with	O
secret	O
pleasure	O
at	O
the	O
misshapen	O
shadow	O
that	O
had	O
to	O
bear	O
the	O
burden	O
that	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
his	O
own.	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
endure	O
to	O
be	O
long	O
out	O
of	O
England	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
up	O
the	O
villa	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
shared	O
at	O
Trouville	O
with	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
little	O
white	O
walled-in	O
house	O
at	O
Algiers	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
spent	O
the	O
winter.	O

He	O
hated	O
to	O
be	O
separated	O
from	O
the	O
picture	O
that	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
also	O
afraid	O
that	O
during	O
his	O
absence	O
some	O
one	O
might	O
gain	O
access	O
to	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
elaborate	O
bars	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
caused	O
to	O
be	O
placed	O
upon	O
the	O
door.	O

He	O
was	O
quite	O
conscious	O
that	O
this	O
would	O
tell	O
them	O
nothing.	O

It	O
was	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
portrait	O
still	O
preserved	O
,	O
under	O
all	O
the	O
foulness	O
and	O
ugliness	O
of	O
the	O
face	O
,	O
its	O
marked	O
likeness	O
to	O
himself	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
could	O
they	O
learn	O
from	O
that	O
?	O

He	O
would	O
laugh	O
at	O
any	O
one	O
who	O
tried	O
to	O
taunt	O
him.	O

He	O
had	O
not	O
painted	O
it.	O

What	O
was	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
how	O
vile	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
shame	O
it	O
looked	O
?	O

Even	O
if	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
would	O
they	O
believe	O
it	O
?	O

Yet	O
he	O
was	O
afraid.	O

Sometimes	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
down	O
at	O
his	O
great	O
house	O
in	O
Nottinghamshire	O
,	O
entertaining	O
the	O
fashionable	O
young	O
men	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
rank	O
who	O
were	O
his	O
chief	O
companions	O
,	O
and	O
astounding	O
the	O
county	O
by	O
the	O
wanton	O
luxury	O
and	O
gorgeous	O
splendour	O
of	O
his	O
mode	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
suddenly	O
leave	O
his	O
guests	O
and	O
rush	O
back	O
to	O
town	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
door	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
tampered	O
with	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
picture	O
was	O
still	O
there.	O

What	O
if	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
stolen	O
?	O

The	O
mere	O
thought	O
made	O
him	O
cold	O
with	O
horror.	O

Surely	O
the	O
world	O
would	O
know	O
his	O
secret	O
then.	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
world	O
already	O
suspected	O
it.	O

For	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
fascinated	O
many	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
a	O
few	O
who	O
distrusted	O
him.	O

He	O
was	O
very	O
nearly	O
blackballed	O
at	O
a	O
West	O
End	O
club	O
of	O
which	O
his	O
birth	O
and	O
social	O
position	O
fully	O
entitled	O
him	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
member	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
said	O
that	O
on	O
one	O
occasion	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
brought	O
by	O
a	O
friend	O
into	O
the	O
smoking-room	O
of	O
the	O
Churchill	O
,	O
the	O
Duke	O
of	O
Berwick	O
and	O
another	O
gentleman	O
got	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
marked	O
manner	O
and	O
went	O
out.	O

Curious	O
stories	O
became	O
current	O
about	O
him	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
passed	O
his	O
twenty-fifth	O
year.	O

It	O
was	O
rumoured	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
brawling	O
with	O
foreign	O
sailors	O
in	O
a	O
low	O
den	O
in	O
the	O
distant	O
parts	O
of	O
Whitechapel	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
consorted	O
with	O
thieves	O
and	O
coiners	O
and	O
knew	O
the	O
mysteries	O
of	O
their	O
trade.	O

His	O
extraordinary	O
absences	O
became	O
notorious	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
reappear	O
again	O
in	O
society	O
,	O
men	O
would	O
whisper	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
in	O
corners	O
,	O
or	O
pass	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
sneer	O
,	O
or	O
look	O
at	O
him	O
with	O
cold	O
searching	O
eyes	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
determined	O
to	O
discover	O
his	O
secret.	O

Of	O
such	O
insolences	O
and	O
attempted	O
slights	O
he	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
most	O
people	O
his	O
frank	O
debonair	O
manner	O
,	O
his	O
charming	O
boyish	O
smile	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
infinite	O
grace	O
of	O
that	O
wonderful	O
youth	O
that	O
seemed	O
never	O
to	O
leave	O
him	O
,	O
were	O
in	O
themselves	O
a	O
sufficient	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O
calumnies	O
,	O
for	O
so	O
they	O
termed	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
circulated	O
about	O
him.	O

It	O
was	O
remarked	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
most	O
intimate	O
with	O
him	O
appeared	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
shun	O
him.	O

Women	O
who	O
had	O
wildly	O
adored	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
his	O
sake	O
had	O
braved	O
all	O
social	O
censure	O
and	O
set	O
convention	O
at	O
defiance	O
,	O
were	O
seen	O
to	O
grow	O
pallid	O
with	O
shame	O
or	O
horror	O
if	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
entered	O
the	O
room.	O

Yet	O
these	O
whispered	O
scandals	O
only	O
increased	O
in	O
the	O
eyes	O
of	O
many	O
his	O
strange	O
and	O
dangerous	O
charm.	O

His	O
great	O
wealth	O
was	O
a	O
certain	O
element	O
of	O
security.	O

Society	O
civilized	O
society	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
is	O
never	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O
believe	O
anything	O
to	O
the	O
detriment	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
both	O
rich	O
and	O
fascinating.	O

It	O
feels	O
instinctively	O
that	O
manners	O
are	O
of	O
more	O
importance	O
than	O
morals	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
its	O
opinion	O
,	O
the	O
highest	O
respectability	O
is	O
of	O
much	O
less	O
value	O
than	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
_chef_.	O

And	O
,	O
after	O
all	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
poor	O
consolation	O
to	O
be	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
has	O
given	O
one	O
a	O
bad	O
dinner	O
,	O
or	O
poor	O
wine	O

is	O
irreproachable	O
in	O

for	O
half-cold	O

Lord	O

remarked	O
once	O

in	O
a	O
discussion	O

the	O

,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
possibly	O
a	O
good	O

to	O
be	O
said	O
for	O

view.	O

For	O
the	O
canons	O
of	O

are	O
,	O
or	O
should	O
be	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
the	O
canons	O
of	O
art.	O

Form	O
is	O
absolutely	O
essential	O
to	O
it.	O

It	O
should	O
have	O
the	O
dignity	O
of	O
a	O
ceremony	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
its	O
unreality	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
combine	O
the	O
insincere	O
character	O
of	O
a	O
romantic	O
play	O
with	O
the	O
wit	O
and	O
beauty	O
that	O
make	O
such	O
plays	O
delightful	O
to	O
us.	O

Is	O
insincerity	O
such	O
a	O
terrible	O
thing	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
not.	O

It	O
is	O
merely	O
a	O
method	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
can	O
multiply	O
our	O
personalities.	O

Such	O

at	O
any	O
rate	O

was	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O

opinion.	O

He	O
used	O
to	O
wonder	O
at	O
the	O
shallow	O
psychology	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
conceive	O
the	O
ego	O
in	O
man	O
as	O
a	O
thing	O
simple	O
,	O
permanent	O

and	O
of	O

To	O
him	O

man	O
was	O
a	O
being	O
with	O
myriad	O
lives	O
and	O
myriad	O

a	O

of	O

whose	O
very	O

was	O
tainted	O
with	O
the	O
monstrous	O

of	O

Staveley	I-QUOTE
curled	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE

said	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
might	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
artistic	I-QUOTE

Once	O

She	O
stumbled	O
away	O

laughing.	O

A	O
bitter	O
blast	O
swept	O
across	O

square.	O

The	O
gas-lamps	O
flickered	O

became	O
blue	O

and	O
the	O

went	O
back	O

closing	O

Having	O
reached	O
the	O

he	O
turned	O
the	O

opened	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
even	O

that	O

secret	O

was	O
not	O

had	O
painted	O
the	O
fatal	O
portrait	O
to	O
which	O
all	O
his	O
misery	O
had	O
been	O
due	O
had	O
gone	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
life.	O

That	O
was	O
enough.	O

Then	O
he	O
remembered	O

lamp.	O

inlaid	O
with	O

studded	O
with	O
coarse	O
turquoises.	O

Perhaps	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
missed	O
by	O
his	O
servant	O
,	O
and	O
questions	O
would	O
be	O
asked.	O

He	O
hesitated	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
turned	O
back	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
table.	O

He	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
seeing	O
the	O
dead	O
thing.	O

How	O
still	O
it	O
was	O
!	O

How	O
horribly	O
white	O
the	O
long	O
hands	O
looked	O
!	O

It	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
dreadful	O

Having	O
locked	O

he	O
crept	O
quietly	O
downstairs.	O

The	O
woodwork	O
creaked	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
cry	O
out	O
as	O
if	O

pain.	O

He	O
stopped	O
several	O
times	O
and	O
waited.	O

No	O
:	O
everything	O
was	O
still.	O

It	O
was	O
merely	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
his	O

footsteps.	O

When	O
he	O
reached	O
the	O

unlocked	O
a	O
secret	O
press	O
that	O
was	O
in	O

a	O
press	O

he	O
kept	O
his	O

put	O
them	O
into	O

He	O
could	O
easily	O
burn	O
them	O

Then	O
he	O
pulled	O
out	O
his	O
watch.	O

It	O
was	O
twenty	O
minutes	O

He	O
sat	O
down	O

Every	O

,	O
almost	O
men	O
were	O
strangled	O
in	O

for	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
done.	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
madness	O
of	O
murder	O
in	O
the	O

Basil	O

the	O

at	O
eleven.	O

No	O

It	O
was	O

gone	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
midnight	O
train	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
intended.	O

With	O
his	O
curious	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
months	O
before	O
any	O

be	O
roused.	O

Months	O

Everything	O
could	O
be	O
destroyed	O
long	O
before	O
then.	O

A	O
sudden	O
thought	O
struck	O
him.	O

He	O
put	O
on	O
his	O
fur	O
coat	O
and	O
hat	O
and	O
went	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
hall.	O

There	O
he	O
paused	O
,	O
hearing	O
the	O
slow	O
heavy	O
tread	O
of	O
the	O
policeman	O
on	O
the	O
pavement	O
outside	O
and	O
seeing	O
the	O
flash	O
of	O
the	O
bull	O
s-eye	O
reflected	O
in	O
the	O
window.	O

He	O
waited	O
and	O
held	O
his	O
breath.	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
he	O
drew	O
back	O
the	O
latch	O
and	O
slipped	O
out	O
,	O
shutting	O
the	O
door	O
very	O
gently	O
behind	O
him.	O

Then	O
he	O
began	O
ringing	O
the	O
bell.	O

In	O
about	O
five	O

his	O

CHAPTER	O
XIV.	O

At	O
nine	O
o	O
clock	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
his	O
servant	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
cup	O
of	O
chocolate	O
on	O
a	O
tray	O
and	O
opened	O
the	O
shutters.	O

Dorian	O
was	O
sleeping	O
quite	O
peacefully	O
,	O
lying	O
on	O
his	O
right	O
side	O
,	O
with	O
one	O
hand	O
underneath	O
his	O
cheek.	O

He	O
looked	O
like	O
a	O
boy	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
tired	O
out	O
with	O
play	O
,	O
or	O
study.	O

The	O
man	O
had	O
to	O
touch	O
him	O
twice	O
on	O
the	O
shoulder	O
before	O
he	O
woke	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
opened	O
his	O
eyes	O
a	O
faint	O
smile	O
passed	O
across	O
his	O
lips	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
lost	O
in	O
some	O
delightful	O
dream.	O

Yet	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
dreamed	O
at	O
all.	O

His	O
night	O
had	O
been	O
untroubled	O
by	O
any	O
images	O
of	O
pleasure	O
or	O
of	O
pain.	O

But	O
youth	O
smiles	O
without	O
any	O
reason.	O

It	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
its	O
chiefest	O
charms.	O

He	O
turned	O
round	O
,	O
and	O
leaning	O
upon	O
his	O
elbow	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
sip	O
his	O
chocolate.	O

The	O
mellow	O
November	O
sun	O
came	O
streaming	O
into	O
the	O
room.	O

The	O
sky	O
was	O
bright	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
genial	O
warmth	O
in	O
the	O
air.	O

It	O
was	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
morning	O
in	O
May.	O

Gradually	O
the	O
events	O
of	O
the	O
preceding	O
night	O
crept	O
with	O
silent	O
,	O
blood-stained	O
feet	O
into	O
his	O
brain	O
and	O
reconstructed	O
themselves	O
there	O
with	O
terrible	O
distinctness.	O

He	O
winced	O
at	O
the	O
memory	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
suffered	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
the	O
same	O
curious	O
feeling	O
of	O
loathing	O
for	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
that	O
had	O
made	O
him	O
kill	O
him	O
as	O
he	O
sat	O
in	O
the	O
chair	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
grew	O
cold	O
with	O
passion.	O

The	O
dead	O
man	O
was	O
still	O
sitting	O
there	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
sunlight	O
now.	O

How	O
horrible	O
that	O
was	O
!	O

Such	O
hideous	O
things	O
were	O
for	O
the	O
darkness	O
,	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
day.	O

He	O
felt	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
brooded	O
on	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
through	O
he	O
would	O
sicken	O
or	O
grow	O
mad.	O

There	O
were	O
sins	O
whose	O
fascination	O
was	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
memory	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
doing	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
strange	O
triumphs	O
that	O
gratified	O
the	O
pride	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
passions	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
to	O
the	O
intellect	O
a	O
quickened	O
sense	O
of	O
joy	O
,	O
greater	O
than	O
any	O
joy	O
they	O
brought	O
,	O
or	O
could	O
ever	O
bring	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
senses.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
thing	O
to	O
be	O
driven	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
mind	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
drugged	O
with	O
poppies	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
strangled	O
lest	O
it	O
might	O
strangle	O
one	O
itself.	O

When	O
the	O
half-hour	O
struck	O
,	O
he	O
passed	O
his	O
hand	O
across	O
his	O
forehead	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
got	O
up	O
hastily	O
and	O
dressed	O
himself	O
with	O
even	O
more	O
than	O
his	O
usual	O
care	O
,	O
giving	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
his	O
necktie	O
and	O
scarf-pin	O
and	O
changing	O
his	O
rings	O
more	O
than	O
once.	O

He	O
spent	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
also	O
over	O
breakfast	O
,	O
tasting	O
the	O
various	O
dishes	O

talking	O

grew	O
nervous	O

and	O
a	O
horrible	O
fit	O
of	O

came	O
over	O

What	O
if	O
Alan	O
Campbell	O
should	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
England	O
?	O

Days	O
would	O
elapse	O
before	O
he	O
could	O

Perhaps	O
he	O
might	O
refuse	O
to	O

What	O
could	O
he	O
do	O
then	O
?	O

Every	O
moment	O
was	O
of	O
vital	O
importance.	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
great	O
friends	O
once	O
,	O
five	O
years	O
before	O
almost	O
inseparable	O
,	O
indeed.	O

Then	O
the	O
intimacy	O
had	O
come	O
suddenly	O
to	O
an	O
end.	O

When	O
they	O
met	O
in	O
society	O
now	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
who	O
smiled	O
:	O
Alan	O
Campbell	O
never	O
did.	O

He	O
was	O
an	O
extremely	O
clever	O
young	O
man	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
real	O
appreciation	O
of	O
the	O
visible	O
arts	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
little	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
beauty	O
of	O
poetry	O
he	O
possessed	O
he	O
had	O
gained	O
entirely	O
from	O
Dorian.	O

His	O
dominant	O
intellectual	O
passion	O
was	O
for	O
science.	O

At	O
Cambridge	O
he	O
had	O
spent	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
his	O
time	O
working	O
in	O
the	O
laboratory	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
good	O
class	O
in	O
the	O
Natural	O
Science	O
Tripos	O
of	O
his	O
year.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
devoted	O
to	O
the	O
study	O
of	O
chemistry	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
laboratory	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
shut	O
himself	O
up	O
all	O
day	O
long	O
,	O
greatly	O
to	O
the	O
annoyance	O
of	O
his	O
mother	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
set	O
her	O
heart	O
on	O
his	O
standing	O
for	O
Parliament	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
vague	O
idea	O
that	O
a	O
chemist	O
was	O
a	O
person	O
who	O
made	O
up	O
prescriptions.	O

He	O
was	O
an	O
excellent	O
musician	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
played	O
both	O
the	O
violin	O
and	O
the	O
piano	O
better	O
than	O
most	O
amateurs.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
music	O
that	O
had	O
first	O
brought	O
him	O
and	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
together	O
music	O
and	O
that	O
indefinable	O
attraction	O
that	O
Dorian	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
exercise	O
whenever	O
he	O
wished	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
exercised	O
often	O
without	O
being	O
conscious	O
of	O
it.	O

They	O
had	O
met	O
at	O
Lady	O
Berkshire	O
s	O
the	O
night	O
that	O
Rubinstein	O
played	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
always	O
seen	O
together	O
at	O
the	O
opera	O
and	O
wherever	O
good	O
music	O
was	O
going	O
on.	O

For	O
eighteen	O
months	O
their	O
intimacy	O
lasted.	O

Campbell	O
was	O
always	O
either	O
at	O
Selby	O
Royal	O
or	O
in	O
Grosvenor	O
Square.	O

To	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
many	O
others	O
,	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
was	O
the	O
type	O
of	O
everything	O
that	O
is	O
wonderful	O
and	O
fascinating	O
in	O
life.	O

Whether	O
or	O
not	O
a	O
quarrel	O
had	O
taken	O
place	O
between	O
them	O
no	O
one	O
ever	O
knew.	O

But	O
suddenly	O
people	O
remarked	O
that	O
they	O
scarcely	O
spoke	O
when	O
they	O
met	O
and	O
that	O
Campbell	O
seemed	O
always	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
early	O
from	O
any	O
party	O
at	O
which	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
was	O
present.	O

He	O
had	O
changed	O
,	O
too	O
was	O
strangely	O
melancholy	O
at	O
times	O
,	O
appeared	O
almost	O
to	O
dislike	O
hearing	O
music	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
never	O
himself	O
play	O
,	O
giving	O
as	O
his	O
excuse	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
called	O
upon	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
absorbed	O
in	O
science	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
time	O
left	O
in	O
which	O
to	O
practise.	O

And	O
this	O
was	O
certainly	O
true.	O

Every	O
day	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
become	O
more	O
interested	O
in	O
biology	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
name	O
appeared	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
scientific	O
reviews	O
in	O
connection	O
with	O
certain	O
curious	O
experiments.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
man	O
Dorian	O
Gray	O
was	O
waiting	O
for.	O

Every	O
second	O
he	O
kept	O
glancing	O
at	O
the	O
clock.	O

As	O
the	O
minutes	O
went	O
by	O
he	O
became	O
horribly	O
agitated.	O

At	O
last	O
he	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
pace	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
looking	O
like	O
a	O
beautiful	O
caged	O
thing.	O

He	O
took	O
long	O
stealthy	O
strides.	O

His	O
hands	O
were	O
curiously	O
cold.	O

The	O
suspense	O
became	O
unbearable.	O

Time	O
seemed	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
crawling	O
with	O
feet	O
of	O
lead	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
by	O
monstrous	O
winds	O
was	O
being	O
swept	O
towards	O
the	O
jagged	O
edge	O
of	O
some	O
black	O
cleft	O
of	O
precipice.	O

He	O
knew	O
what	O
was	O
waiting	O
for	O
him	O
there	O
;	O
saw	O
it	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
shuddering	O
,	O
crushed	O
with	O
dank	O
hands	O
his	O
burning	O
lids	O
as	O
though	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
robbed	O
the	O
very	O
brain	O
of	O
sight	O
and	O
driven	O
the	O
eyeballs	O
back	O
into	O
their	O
cave.	O

It	O
was	O
useless.	O

The	O
brain	O
had	O
its	O
own	O
food	O
on	O
which	O
it	O
battened	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
imagination	O

made	O

like	O
some	O
foul	O
puppet	O
on	O
a	O

grinned	O
through	O

suddenly	O

The	O

hunger	O

gnaw	O
at	O
him.	O

His	O

He	O
laughed	O

the	O

was	O
silent.	O

The	O

and	O
the	O
streets	O
like	O
the	O

The	O

became	O
unbearable	O

as	O

he	O

Then	O

with	O
their	O

by	O
,	O
and	O
far	O
away	O
in	O
the	O

some	O

The	O
horse	O

in	O
a	O
rut	O
,	O
then	O
swerved	O
aside	O
and	O
broke	O
into	O
a	O
gallop.	O

After	O

time	O
they	O
left	O
the	O

and	O
rattled	O
again	O
over	O
rough-paven	O

Most	O

were	O

but	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
fantastic	O

were	O
silhouetted	O
against	O
some	O

He	O
watched	O
them	O
curiously.	O

They	O
moved	O
like	O
monstrous	O
marionettes	O
and	O
made	O
gestures	O
like	O

He	O
hated	O
them.	O

A	O
dull	O
rage	O
was	O
in	O
his	O
heart.	O

As	O
they	O
turned	O
a	O

a	O

something	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
happened	I-QUOTE
yesterday	I-QUOTE

they	I-QUOTE
solemnly	I-QUOTE
give	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
opinions	I-QUOTE
current	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
1820	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
wore	I-QUOTE
high	I-QUOTE
stocks	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
believed	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
knew	I-QUOTE
absolutely	I-QUOTE
nothing.	I-QUOTE

How	I-QUOTE
lovely	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
playing	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
Chopin	I-QUOTE
write	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
Majorca	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
sea	I-QUOTE
weeping	I-QUOTE
round	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
villa	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
salt	I-QUOTE
spray	I-QUOTE
dashing	I-QUOTE
against	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
panes	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
marvellously	I-QUOTE
romantic.	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
blessing	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
art	I-QUOTE
left	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
imitative	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

Don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
stop.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
want	I-QUOTE
music	I-QUOTE
to-night.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
seems	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
Apollo	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
Marsyas	I-QUOTE
listening	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
sorrows	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
even	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
of.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
tragedy	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
age	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
young.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
amazed	I-QUOTE
sometimes	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
sincerity.	I-QUOTE

Ah	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
happy	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
drunk	I-QUOTE
deeply	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
everything.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
crushed	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
grapes	I-QUOTE
against	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
palate.	I-QUOTE

Nothing	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
hidden	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
sound	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
music.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
marred	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
still	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
same.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
I	B-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
same	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Yes	B-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
same.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
rest	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
be.	I-QUOTE

Don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
spoil	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
renunciations.	I-QUOTE

At	I-QUOTE
present	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
perfect	I-QUOTE
type.	I-QUOTE

Don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
make	I-QUOTE
yourself	I-QUOTE
incomplete.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
flawless	I-QUOTE
now.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
need	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
shake	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
head	I-QUOTE
:	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are.	I-QUOTE

Besides	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
deceive	I-QUOTE
yourself.	I-QUOTE

Life	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
governed	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
intention.	I-QUOTE

Life	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
question	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
nerves	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
fibres	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
slowly	I-QUOTE
built-up	I-QUOTE
cells	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
hides	I-QUOTE
itself	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
dreams.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
may	I-QUOTE
fancy	I-QUOTE
yourself	I-QUOTE
safe	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
yourself	I-QUOTE
strong.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
chance	I-QUOTE
tone	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
colour	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
room	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
morning	I-QUOTE
sky	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
particular	I-QUOTE
perfume	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
loved	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
brings	I-QUOTE
subtle	I-QUOTE
memories	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
line	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
forgotten	I-QUOTE
poem	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
across	I-QUOTE
again	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
cadence	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
piece	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
music	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
ceased	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
these	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
lives	I-QUOTE
depend.	I-QUOTE

Browning	I-QUOTE
writes	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
somewhere	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
senses	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
imagine	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
us.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
moments	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
odour	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
_lilas	I-QUOTE
blanc_	I-QUOTE
passes	I-QUOTE
suddenly	I-QUOTE
across	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
live	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
strangest	I-QUOTE
month	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
wish	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
change	I-QUOTE
places	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
world	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
cried	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
against	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
both	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
worshipped	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
worship	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
type	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
age	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
searching	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
afraid	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
found.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
glad	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
anything	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
carved	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
statue	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
painted	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
picture	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
produced	I-QUOTE
anything	I-QUOTE
outside	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
yourself	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

Life	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
art.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
set	I-QUOTE
yourself	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
music.	I-QUOTE

Your	I-QUOTE
days	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
sonnets.	I-QUOTE

extravagant	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE

know	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE

even	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
turn	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Why	B-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
stopped	I-QUOTE
playing	I-QUOTE

Go	I-QUOTE
back	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
give	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
nocturne	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

Look	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE

honey-coloured	I-QUOTE
moon	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
hangs	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dusky	I-QUOTE
air.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
waiting	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
charm	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
closer	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
earth.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
won	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

Let	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
club	I-QUOTE

then.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
charming	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
end	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE

harm.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
My	B-QUOTE
dear	I-QUOTE
boy	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
beginning	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
moralize.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
soon	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
converted	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
revivalist	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
warning	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
against	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
sins	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
grown	I-QUOTE
tired.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
delightful	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
that.	I-QUOTE

Besides	I-QUOTE

for	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
poisoned	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE

there	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE

that.	I-QUOTE

Art	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
influence	I-QUOTE
upon	I-QUOTE
action.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
annihilates	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
desire	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
act.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
superbly	I-QUOTE
sterile.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
books	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

calls	I-QUOTE
immoral	I-QUOTE

books	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE

XX.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
lovely	O
night	O
,	O
so	O
warm	O
that	O
he	O
threw	O
his	O
coat	O
over	O
his	O
arm	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
even	O
put	O
his	O
silk	O
scarf	O
round	O
his	O
throat.	O

As	O
he	O
strolled	O
home	O
,	O
smoking	O
his	O
cigarette	O
,	O
two	O
young	O
men	O
in	O
evening	O
dress	O
passed	O
him.	O

"	O
He	O
remembered	O
how	O
pleased	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
pointed	O
out	O
,	O
or	O
stared	O
at	O
,	O
or	O
talked	O
about.	O

He	O
was	O
tired	O
of	O
hearing	O
his	O
own	O
name	O
now.	O

Half	O
the	O
charm	O
of	O
the	O
little	O
village	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
often	O
lately	O
was	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
knew	O
who	O
he	O
was.	O

He	O
had	O
often	O
told	O
the	O
girl	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
lured	O
to	O
love	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
poor	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
believed	O
him.	O

He	O
had	O
told	O
her	O
once	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
wicked	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
laughed	O
at	O
him	O
and	O
answered	O
that	O
wicked	O
people	O
were	O
always	O
very	O
old	O
and	O
very	O
ugly.	O

What	O
a	O
laugh	O
she	O
had	O
!	O

just	O
like	O
a	O
thrush	O
singing.	O

And	O
how	O
pretty	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
her	O
cotton	O
dresses	O
and	O
her	O
large	O
hats	O
!	O

She	O
knew	O
nothing	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
had	O
everything	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
lost.	O

When	O
he	O
reached	O
home	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
his	O
servant	O
waiting	O
up	O
for	O
him.	O

He	O
sent	O
him	O
to	O
bed	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
himself	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
sofa	O
in	O
the	O
library	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
over	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
said	O
to	O
him.	O

Was	O
it	O
really	O
true	O
that	O
one	O
could	O
never	O
change	O
?	O

He	O
felt	O
a	O
wild	O
longing	O
for	O
the	O
unstained	O
purity	O
of	O
his	O
boyhood	O
his	O
rose-white	O
boyhood	O
,	O
as	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
once	O
called	O
it.	O

He	O
knew	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
tarnished	O
himself	O
,	O
filled	O
his	O
mind	O
with	O
corruption	O
and	O
given	O
horror	O
to	O
his	O
fancy	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
an	O
evil	O
influence	O
to	O
others	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
experienced	O
a	O
terrible	O
joy	O
in	O
being	O
so	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
lives	O
that	O
had	O
crossed	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
fairest	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
full	O
of	O
promise	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
to	O
shame.	O

But	O
was	O
it	O
all	O
irretrievable	O
?	O

Was	O
there	O
no	O
hope	O
for	O
him	O
?	O

Ah	O
!	O

in	O
what	O
a	O
monstrous	O
moment	O
of	O
pride	O
and	O
passion	O
he	O
had	O
prayed	O
that	O
the	O
portrait	O
should	O
bear	O
the	O
burden	O
of	O
his	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
keep	O
the	O
unsullied	O
splendour	O
of	O
eternal	O
youth	O
!	O

All	O
his	O
failure	O
had	O
been	O
due	O
to	O
that.	O

Better	O
for	O
him	O
that	O
each	O
sin	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
had	O
brought	O
its	O
sure	O
swift	O
penalty	O
along	O
with	O
it.	O

There	O
was	O
purification	O
in	O
punishment.	O

The	O
curiously	O
carved	O
mirror	O
that	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
given	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
so	O
many	O
years	O
ago	O
now	O
,	O
was	O
standing	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
white-limbed	O
Cupids	O
laughed	O
round	O
it	O
as	O
of	O
old.	O

He	O
took	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
on	O
that	O
night	O
of	O
horror	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
first	O
noted	O
the	O
change	O
in	O
the	O
fatal	O
picture	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
wild	O
,	O
tear-dimmed	O
eyes	O
looked	O
into	O
its	O
polished	O
shield.	O

Once	O
,	O
some	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
terribly	O
loved	O
him	O
had	O
written	O
to	O
him	O
a	O
mad	O
letter	O
,	O
ending	O
with	O
these	O
idolatrous	O
words	O
:	O
"	O
The	O
world	O
is	O
changed	O
because	O
you	O
are	O
made	O
of	O
ivory	O
and	O
gold.	O

The	O
curves	O
of	O
your	O
lips	O

"	O
The	O
phrases	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
his	O
memory	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
repeated	O
them	O
over	O
and	O
over	O
to	O
himself.	O

Then	O
he	O
loathed	O
his	O
own	O
beauty	O
,	O
and	O
flinging	O
the	O
mirror	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O
,	O
crushed	O
it	O
into	O
silver	O
splinters	O
beneath	O
his	O
heel.	O

It	O
was	O
his	O
beauty	O
that	O
had	O
ruined	O
him	O
,	O
his	O
beauty	O
and	O
the	O
youth	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
prayed	O
for.	O

But	O
for	O
those	O
two	O
things	O
,	O
his	O
life	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
free	O
from	O
stain.	O

His	O
beauty	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
him	O
but	O
a	O
mask	O
,	O
his	O
youth	O
but	O
a	O
mockery.	O

What	O
was	O
youth	O
at	O
best	O
?	O

A	O
green	O
,	O
an	O
unripe	O
time	O
,	O
a	O
time	O
of	O
shallow	O
moods	O
,	O
and	O
sickly	O
thoughts.	O

Why	O
had	O
he	O
worn	O
its	O
livery	O
?	O

Youth	O
had	O
spoiled	O
him.	O

It	O
was	O
better	O
not	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
past.	O

Nothing	O
could	O
alter	O
that.	O

It	O
was	O
of	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
future	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
think.	O

James	O
Vane	O
was	O
hidden	O
in	O
a	O
nameless	O
grave	O
in	O
Selby	O
churchyard.	O

Alan	O
Campbell	O
had	O
shot	O
himself	O
one	O
night	O
in	O
his	O
laboratory	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
not	O
revealed	O
the	O
secret	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
forced	O
to	O
know.	O

The	O
excitement	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
over	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
s	O
disappearance	O
would	O
soon	O
pass	O
away.	O

It	O
was	O
already	O
waning.	O

He	O
was	O
perfectly	O
safe	O
there.	O

Nor	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
it	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
that	O
weighed	O
most	O
upon	O
his	O
mind.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
living	O
death	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
soul	O
that	O
troubled	O
him.	O

Basil	O
had	O
painted	O
the	O
portrait	O
that	O
had	O
marred	O
his	O
life.	O

He	O
could	O
not	O
forgive	O
him	O
that.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
portrait	O
that	O
had	O
done	O
everything.	O

Basil	O
had	O
said	O
things	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
were	O
unbearable	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
yet	O
borne	O
with	O
patience.	O

The	O
murder	O
had	O
been	O
simply	O
the	O
madness	O
of	O
a	O
moment.	O

As	O
for	O
Alan	O
Campbell	O
,	O
his	O
suicide	O
had	O
been	O
his	O
own	O
act.	O

He	O
had	O
chosen	O
to	O
do	O
it.	O

It	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
him.	O

A	O
new	O
life	O
!	O

That	O
was	O
what	O
he	O
wanted.	O

That	O
was	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
waiting	O
for.	O

Surely	O
he	O
had	O
begun	O
it	O
already.	O

He	O
had	O
spared	O
one	O
innocent	O
thing	O
,	O
at	O
any	O
rate.	O

He	O
would	O
never	O
again	O
tempt	O
innocence.	O

He	O
would	O
be	O
good.	O

As	O
he	O
thought	O
of	O
Hetty	O
Merton	O
,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
wonder	O
if	O
the	O
portrait	O
in	O
the	O
locked	O
room	O
had	O
changed.	O

Surely	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
still	O
so	O
horrible	O
as	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
?	O

Perhaps	O
if	O
his	O
life	O
became	O
pure	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
expel	O
every	O
sign	O
of	O
evil	O
passion	O
from	O
the	O
face.	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
signs	O
of	O
evil	O
had	O
already	O
gone	O
away.	O

He	O
would	O
go	O
and	O
look.	O

He	O
took	O
the	O
lamp	O
from	O
the	O
table	O
and	O
crept	O
upstairs.	O

As	O
he	O
unbarred	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
a	O
smile	O
of	O
joy	O
flitted	O
across	O
his	O
strangely	O
young-looking	O
face	O
and	O
lingered	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
about	O
his	O
lips.	O

Yes	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hideous	O
thing	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
hidden	O
away	O
would	O
no	O
longer	O
be	O
a	O
terror	O
to	O
him.	O

He	O
felt	O
as	O
if	O
the	O
load	O
had	O
been	O
lifted	O
from	O
him	O
already.	O

He	O
went	O
in	O
quietly	O
,	O
locking	O
the	O
door	O
behind	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
his	O
custom	O
,	O
and	O
dragged	O
the	O
purple	O
hanging	O
from	O
the	O
portrait.	O

A	O
cry	O
of	O
pain	O
and	O
indignation	O
broke	O
from	O
him.	O

He	O
could	O
see	O
no	O
change	O
,	O
save	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
eyes	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
cunning	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
the	O
curved	O
wrinkle	O
of	O
the	O
hypocrite.	O

The	O
thing	O
was	O
still	O
loathsome	O
more	O
loathsome	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
than	O
before	O
and	O
the	O
scarlet	O
dew	O
that	O
spotted	O
the	O
hand	O
seemed	O
brighter	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
like	O
blood	O
newly	O
spilled.	O

Then	O
he	O
trembled.	O

Had	O
it	O
been	O
merely	O
vanity	O
that	O
had	O
made	O
him	O
do	O
his	O
one	O
good	O
deed	O
?	O

Or	O
the	O
desire	O
for	O
a	O
new	O
sensation	O
,	O
as	O
Lord	O
Henry	O
had	O
hinted	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
mocking	O
laugh	O
?	O

Or	O
that	O
passion	O
to	O
act	O
a	O
part	O
that	O
sometimes	O
makes	O
us	O
do	O
things	O
finer	O
than	O
we	O
are	O
ourselves	O
?	O

Or	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
all	O
these	O
?	O

And	O
why	O
was	O
the	O
red	O
stain	O
larger	O
than	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
?	O

It	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
crept	O
like	O
a	O
horrible	O
disease	O
over	O
the	O
wrinkled	O
fingers.	O

There	O
was	O
blood	O
on	O
the	O
painted	O
feet	O
,	O
as	O
though	O
the	O
thing	O
had	O
dripped	O
blood	O
even	O
on	O
the	O
hand	O
that	O
had	O
not	O
held	O
the	O
knife.	O

Confess	O
?	O

Did	O
it	O
mean	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
confess	O
?	O

To	O
give	O
himself	O
up	O
and	O
be	O
put	O
to	O
death	O
?	O

He	O
laughed.	O

He	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
idea	O
was	O
monstrous.	O

Besides	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
confess	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
believe	O
him	O
?	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
trace	O
of	O
the	O
murdered	O
man	O
anywhere.	O

Everything	O
belonging	O
to	O
him	O
had	O
been	O
destroyed.	O

He	O
himself	O
had	O
burned	O
what	O
had	O
been	O
below-stairs.	O

The	O
world	O
would	O
simply	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
mad.	O

They	O
would	O
shut	O
him	O
up	O
if	O
he	O
persisted	O
in	O
his	O
story	O
...	O

.	O

Yet	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
duty	O
to	O
confess	O
,	O
to	O
suffer	O
public	O
shame	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
public	O
atonement.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
God	O
who	O
called	O
upon	O
men	O
to	O
tell	O
their	O
sins	O
to	O
earth	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
heaven.	O

Nothing	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
do	O
would	O
cleanse	O
him	O
till	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
his	O
own	O
sin.	O

His	O
sin	O
?	O

He	O
shrugged	O
his	O
shoulders.	O

The	O
death	O
of	O
Basil	O
Hallward	O
seemed	O
very	O
little	O
to	O
him.	O

He	O
was	O
thinking	O
of	O
Hetty	O
Merton.	O

For	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
unjust	O
mirror	O
,	O
this	O
mirror	O
of	O
his	O
soul	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
looking	O
at.	O

Vanity	O
?	O

Curiosity	O
?	O

Hypocrisy	O
?	O

Had	O
there	O
been	O
nothing	O
more	O
in	O
his	O
renunciation	O
than	O
that	O
?	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
something	O
more.	O

At	O
least	O
he	O
thought	O
so.	O

But	O
who	O
could	O
tell	O
?	O

...	O

No.	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
nothing	O
more.	O

Through	O
vanity	O
he	O
had	O
spared	O
her.	O

In	O
hypocrisy	O
he	O
had	O
worn	O
the	O
mask	O
of	O
goodness.	O

For	O
curiosity	O
s	O
sake	O
he	O
had	O
tried	O
the	O
denial	O
of	O
self.	O

He	O
recognized	O
that	O
now.	O

But	O
this	O
murder	O
was	O
it	O
to	O
dog	O
him	O
all	O
his	O
life	O
?	O

Was	O
he	O
always	O
to	O
be	O
burdened	O
by	O
his	O
past	O
?	O

Was	O
he	O
really	O
to	O
confess	O
?	O

Never.	O

There	O
was	O
only	O
one	O
bit	O
of	O
evidence	O
left	O
against	O
him.	O

The	O
picture	O
itself	O
that	O
was	O
evidence.	O

He	O
would	O
destroy	O
it.	O

Why	O
had	O
he	O
kept	O
it	O
so	O
long	O
?	O

Once	O
it	O
had	O
given	O
him	O
pleasure	O
to	O
watch	O
it	O
changing	O
and	O
growing	O
old.	O

Of	O
late	O
he	O
had	O
felt	O
no	O
such	O
pleasure.	O

It	O
had	O
kept	O

When	O
he	O
had	O

away	O

he	O
had	O
been	O
filled	O
with	O
terror	O
lest	O
other	O
eyes	O
should	O
look	O
upon	O
it.	O

It	O
had	O
brought	O
melancholy	O
across	O
his	O
passions.	O

Its	O
mere	O
memory	O
had	O
marred	O
many	O
moments	O
of	O
joy.	O

It	O
had	O
been	O
like	O
conscience	O
to	O
him.	O

Yes	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
conscience.	O

He	O
would	O
destroy	O
it.	O

He	O
looked	O
round	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
knife	O
that	O
had	O
stabbed	O
Basil	O
Hallward.	O

He	O
had	O
cleaned	O
it	O
many	O
times	O
,	O
till	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
stain	O
left	O
upon	O
it.	O

It	O
was	O
bright	O
,	O
and	O
glistened.	O

As	O
it	O
had	O
killed	O
the	O
painter	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
would	O
kill	O
the	O
painter	O
s	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
that	O
meant.	O

It	O
would	O
kill	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
that	O
was	O
dead	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
free.	O

It	O
would	O
kill	O
this	O
monstrous	O
soul-life	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
its	O
hideous	O
warnings	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
at	O
peace.	O

He	O
seized	O
the	O
thing	O

and	O
stabbed	O
the	O
picture	O
with	O
it.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
cry	O
heard	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
crash.	O

The	O
cry	O
was	O
so	O
horrible	O
in	O
its	O
agony	O
that	O
the	O
frightened	O
servants	O
woke	O
and	O
crept	O
out	O

They	O
walked	O
on	O

they	O
met	O
a	O

and	O
brought	O
him	O
back.	O

The	O
man	O
rang	O
the	O
bell	O
several	O
times	O

but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

of	O
the	O

the	O
house	O

all	O
dark.	O

After	O
a	O
time	O

he	O
went	O
away	O
and	O
stood	O
in	O
an	O

he	O
