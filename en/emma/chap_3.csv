Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
was	O
fond	O
of	O
society	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
way.	O

He	O
liked	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
have	O
his	O
friends	O
come	O
and	O
see	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
various	O
united	O
causes	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
long	O
residence	O
at	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
good	O
nature	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
fortune	O
,	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
daughter	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
command	O
the	O
visits	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
little	O
circle	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
liked.	O

He	O
had	O
not	O
much	O
intercourse	O
with	O
any	O
families	O
beyond	O
that	O
circle	O
;	O
his	O
horror	O
of	O
late	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
dinner-parties	O
,	O
made	O
him	O
unfit	O
for	O
any	O
acquaintance	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
would	O
visit	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
terms.	O

Fortunately	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
Highbury	O
,	O
including	O
Randalls	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
parish	O
,	O
and	O
Donwell	O
Abbey	O
in	O
the	O
parish	O
adjoining	O
,	O
the	O
seat	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
,	O
comprehended	O
many	O
such.	O

Not	O
unfrequently	O
,	O
through	O
Emma	O
's	O
persuasion	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
chosen	O
and	O
the	O
best	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
him	O
:	O
but	O
evening	O
parties	O
were	O
what	O
he	O
preferred	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
unless	O
he	O
fancied	O
himself	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
unequal	O
to	O
company	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
scarcely	O
an	O
evening	O
in	O
the	O
week	O
in	O
which	O
Emma	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
up	O
a	O
card-table	O
for	O
him.	O

Real	O
,	O
long-standing	O
regard	O
brought	O
the	O
Westons	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Elton	O
,	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
living	O
alone	O
without	O
liking	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
privilege	O
of	O
exchanging	O
any	O
vacant	O
evening	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
blank	O
solitude	O
for	O
the	O
elegancies	O
and	O
society	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
drawing-room	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
smiles	O
of	O
his	O
lovely	O
daughter	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
no	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
thrown	O
away.	O

After	O
these	O
came	O
a	O
second	O
set	O
;	O
among	O
the	O
most	O
come-at-able	O
of	O
whom	O
were	O
Mrs.	O

and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
,	O
and	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
,	O
three	O
ladies	O
almost	O
always	O
at	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
an	O
invitation	O
from	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
were	O
fetched	O
and	O
carried	O
home	O
so	O
often	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
thought	O
it	O
no	O
hardship	O
for	O
either	O
James	O
or	O
the	O
horses.	O

Had	O
it	O
taken	O
place	O
only	O
once	O
a	O
year	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
grievance.	O

Mrs.	O

Bates	O
,	O
the	O
widow	O
of	O
a	O
former	O
vicar	O
of	O
Highbury	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
old	O
lady	O
,	O
almost	O
past	O
every	O
thing	O
but	O
tea	O
and	O
quadrille.	O

She	O
lived	O
with	O
her	O
single	O
daughter	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
considered	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
regard	O
and	O
respect	O
which	O
a	O
harmless	O
old	O
lady	O
,	O
under	O
such	O
untoward	O
circumstances	O
,	O
can	O
excite.	O

Her	O
daughter	O
enjoyed	O
a	O
most	O
uncommon	O
degree	O
of	O
popularity	O
for	O
a	O
woman	O
neither	O
young	O
,	O
handsome	O
,	O
rich	O
,	O
nor	O
married.	O

Miss	O
Bates	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
worst	O
predicament	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
for	O
having	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
favour	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
no	O
intellectual	O
superiority	O
to	O
make	O
atonement	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
or	O
frighten	O
those	O
who	O
might	O
hate	O
her	O
into	O
outward	O
respect.	O

She	O
had	O
never	O
boasted	O
either	O
beauty	O
or	O
cleverness.	O

Her	O
youth	O
had	O
passed	O
without	O
distinction	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
middle	O
of	O
life	O
was	O
devoted	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
a	O
failing	O
mother	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
endeavour	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
small	O
income	O
go	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
possible.	O

And	O
yet	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
happy	O
woman	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
woman	O
whom	O
no	O
one	O
named	O
without	O
good-will.	O

It	O
was	O
her	O
own	O
universal	O
good-will	O
and	O
contented	O
temper	O
which	O
worked	O
such	O
wonders.	O

She	O
loved	O
every	O
body	O
,	O
was	O
interested	O
in	O
every	O
body	O
's	O
happiness	O
,	O
quicksighted	O
to	O
every	O
body	O
's	O
merits	O
;	O
thought	O
herself	O
a	O
most	O
fortunate	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
surrounded	O
with	O
blessings	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
excellent	O
mother	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
many	O
good	O
neighbours	O
and	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
home	O
that	O
wanted	O
for	O
nothing.	O

The	O
simplicity	O
and	O
cheerfulness	O
of	O
her	O
nature	O
,	O
her	O
contented	O
and	O
grateful	O
spirit	O
,	O
were	O
a	O
recommendation	O
to	O
every	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
mine	O
of	O
felicity	O
to	O
herself.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
talker	O
upon	O
little	O
matters	O
,	O
which	O
exactly	O
suited	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
trivial	O
communications	O
and	O
harmless	O
gossip.	O

Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
was	O
the	O
mistress	O
of	O
a	O
School	O
--	O
not	O
of	O
a	O
seminary	O

or	O
an	O

professed	O

in	O
long	O
sentences	O
of	O

to	O
combine	O
liberal	O
acquirements	O
with	O
elegant	O
morality	O

upon	O
new	O
principles	O
and	O
new	O
systems	O
--	O
and	O
where	O
young	O
ladies	O
for	O
enormous	O
pay	O
might	O
be	O
screwed	O
out	O
of	O
health	O
and	O
into	O
vanity	O
--	O
but	O
a	O
real	O

honest	O

old-fashioned	O
Boarding-school	O

where	O
a	O
reasonable	O
quantity	O
of	O
accomplishments	O
were	O
sold	O
at	O
a	O

price	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
girls	O
might	O

and	O

into	O
a	O
little	O
education	O

without	O
any	O
danger	O
of	O

back	O
prodigies.	O

Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
's	O
school	O
was	O
in	O
high	O
repute	O
--	O
and	O
very	O
deservedly	O
;	O
for	O
Highbury	O
was	O
reckoned	O
a	O
particularly	O
healthy	O
spot	O
:	O
she	O
had	O
an	O
ample	O
house	O
and	O
garden	O
,	O
gave	O
the	O
children	O
plenty	O
of	O
wholesome	O
food	O
,	O
let	O
them	O
run	O
about	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
winter	O
dressed	O
their	O
chilblains	O
with	O
her	O
own	O
hands.	O

It	O
was	O
no	O
wonder	O
that	O
a	O
train	O
of	O
twenty	O
young	O
couple	O
now	O
walked	O
after	O
her	O
to	O
church.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
plain	O
,	O
motherly	O
kind	O
of	O
woman	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
worked	O
hard	O
in	O
her	O
youth	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
thought	O
herself	O
entitled	O
to	O
the	O
occasional	O
holiday	O
of	O
a	O
tea-visit	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
formerly	O
owed	O
much	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
kindness	O
,	O
felt	O
his	O
particular	O
claim	O
on	O
her	O
to	O
leave	O
her	O
neat	O
parlour	O
,	O
hung	O
round	O
with	O
fancy-work	O

whenever	O

could	O

and	O
win	O
or	O
lose	O
a	O
few	O
sixpences	O
by	O
his	O
fireside.	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
ladies	O
whom	O
Emma	O
found	O
herself	O
very	O
frequently	O
able	O
to	O
collect	O
;	O
and	O
happy	O
was	O
she	O

for	O
her	O

;	O
though	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
she	O
was	O
herself	O
concerned	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
for	O
the	O
absence	O
of	O
Mrs.	O

Weston.	O

She	O
was	O
delighted	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
father	O
look	O
comfortable	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
herself	O
for	O
contriving	O
things	O
so	O
well	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
quiet	O
prosings	O
of	O
three	O
such	O
women	O
made	O
her	O
feel	O
that	O
every	O
evening	O
so	O
spent	O
was	O
indeed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
evenings	O
she	O
had	O
fearfully	O
anticipated.	O

As	O
she	O
sat	O
one	O
morning	O
,	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
exactly	O
such	O
a	O
close	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
day	O
,	O
a	O
note	O
was	O
brought	O
from	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
,	O
requesting	O

in	O
most	O
respectful	O
terms	O
,	O
to	O

allowed	O
to	O
bring	O
Miss	O
Smith	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
a	O
most	O
welcome	O
request	O
:	O
for	O
Miss	O
Smith	O
was	O
a	O
girl	O
of	O
seventeen	O
,	O
whom	O
Emma	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
by	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
long	O
felt	O
an	O
interest	O
in	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
her	O
beauty.	O

A	O
very	O
gracious	O
invitation	O
was	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
evening	O
no	O
longer	O
dreaded	O
by	O
the	O
fair	O
mistress	O
of	O
the	O
mansion.	O

Harriet	O
Smith	O
was	O
the	O
natural	O
daughter	O
of	O
somebody.	O

Somebody	O
had	O
placed	O
her	O
,	O
several	O
years	O
back	O
,	O
at	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
's	O
school	O
,	O
and	O
somebody	O
had	O
lately	O
raised	O
her	O
from	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
scholar	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
parlour-boarder.	O

This	O
was	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
generally	O
known	O
of	O
her	O
history.	O

She	O
had	O
no	O
visible	O
friends	O
but	O
what	O
had	O
been	O
acquired	O
at	O
Highbury	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
now	O
just	O
returned	O
from	O
a	O
long	O
visit	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
some	O
young	O
ladies	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
school	O
there	O
with	O
her.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
girl	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
beauty	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
a	O
sort	O
which	O
Emma	O
particularly	O
admired.	O

She	O
was	O
short	O
,	O
plump	O
,	O
and	O
fair	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
bloom	O
,	O
blue	O
eyes	O
,	O
light	O
hair	O
,	O
regular	O
features	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
great	O
sweetness	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
Emma	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
her	O
manners	O
as	O
her	O
person	O
,	O
and	O
quite	O
determined	O
to	O
continue	O
the	O
acquaintance.	O

She	O
was	O
not	O
struck	O
by	O
any	O
thing	O
remarkably	O
clever	O
in	O
Miss	O
Smith	O
's	O
conversation	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
found	O
her	O
altogether	O
very	O
engaging	O
--	O
not	O
inconveniently	O
shy	O
,	O
not	O
unwilling	O
to	O
talk	O
--	O
and	O
yet	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
pushing	O
,	O
shewing	O
so	O
proper	O
and	O
becoming	O
a	O
deference	O
,	O
seeming	O
so	O
pleasantly	O
grateful	O
for	O
being	O
admitted	O
to	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
artlessly	O
impressed	O
by	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
every	O
thing	O
in	O
so	O
superior	O
a	O
style	O
to	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
must	O
have	O
good	O
sense	O
,	O
and	O
deserve	O
encouragement.	O

Encouragement	O
should	O
be	O
given.	O

Those	O
soft	O
blue	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
those	O
natural	O
graces	O
,	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
wasted	O
on	O
the	O
inferior	O
society	O
of	O
Highbury	O
and	O
its	O
connexions.	O

The	O
acquaintance	O
she	O
had	O
already	O
formed	O
were	O
unworthy	O
of	O
her.	O

The	O
friends	O
from	O
whom	O
she	O
had	O
just	O
parted	O
,	O
though	O
very	O
good	O
sort	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
doing	O
her	O
harm.	O

They	O
were	O
a	O
family	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Martin	O

whom	O
Emma	O
well	O
knew	O
by	O
character	O

as	O
renting	O
a	O
large	O
farm	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
,	O
and	O
residing	O
in	O
the	O
parish	O
of	O
Donwell	O
--	O
very	O
creditably	O

she	O
believed	O
--	O
she	O
knew	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
thought	O
highly	O
of	O
them	O
--	O
but	O
they	O
must	O
be	O
coarse	O
and	O
unpolished	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
unfit	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
intimates	O
of	O
a	O
girl	O
who	O
wanted	O
only	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
knowledge	O

elegance	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
perfect.	O

_She_	O
would	O
notice	O
her	O

she	O
would	O
improve	O
her	O

she	O
would	O
detach	O
her	O
from	O
her	O
bad	O
acquaintance	O

and	O
introduce	O
her	O
into	O
good	O
society	O

her	O

in	O

her	O
leisure	O

She	O
was	O

in	O
admiring	O
those	O
soft	O

in	O
