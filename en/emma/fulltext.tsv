Emma	O
Woodhouse	O
,	O
handsome	O
,	O
clever	O
,	O
and	O
rich	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
comfortable	O
home	O
and	O
happy	O
disposition	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
unite	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
blessings	O
of	O
existence	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
lived	O
nearly	O
twenty-one	O
years	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
to	O
distress	O
or	O
vex	O
her.	O

She	O
was	O
the	O
youngest	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
daughters	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
affectionate	O
,	O
indulgent	O
father	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
her	O
sister	O
's	O
marriage	O
,	O
been	O
mistress	O
of	O
his	O
house	O
from	O
a	O
very	O
early	O
period.	O

Her	O
mother	O
had	O
died	O
too	O
long	O
ago	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
have	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
indistinct	O
remembrance	O
of	O
her	O
caresses	O
;	O
and	O
her	O
place	O
had	O
been	O
supplied	O
by	O
an	O
excellent	O
woman	O
as	O
governess	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
fallen	O
little	O
short	O
of	O
a	O
mother	O
in	O
affection.	O

Sixteen	O
years	O
had	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
been	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
family	O
,	O
less	O
as	O
a	O
governess	O
than	O
a	O
friend	O
,	O
very	O
fond	O
of	O
both	O
daughters	O
,	O
but	O
particularly	O
of	O
Emma.	O

Between	O
_them_	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
the	O
intimacy	O
of	O
sisters.	O

Even	O
before	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
had	O
ceased	O
to	O
hold	O
the	O
nominal	O
office	O
of	O
governess	O
,	O
the	O
mildness	O
of	O
her	O
temper	O
had	O
hardly	O
allowed	O
her	O
to	O
impose	O
any	O
restraint	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
shadow	O
of	O
authority	O
being	O
now	O
long	O
passed	O
away	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
living	O
together	O
as	O
friend	O
and	O
friend	O
very	O
mutually	O
attached	O
,	O
and	O
Emma	O
doing	O
just	O
what	O
she	O
liked	O
;	O
highly	O
esteeming	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
's	O
judgment	O
,	O
but	O
directed	O
chiefly	O
by	O
her	O
own.	O

The	O
real	O
evils	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
of	O
Emma	O
's	O
situation	O
were	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
having	O
rather	O
too	O
much	O
her	O
own	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O
think	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
well	O
of	O
herself	O
;	O
these	O
were	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
which	O
threatened	O
alloy	O
to	O
her	O
many	O
enjoyments.	O

The	O
danger	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
was	O
at	O
present	O
so	O
unperceived	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
rank	O
as	O
misfortunes	O
with	O
her.	O

Sorrow	O
came	O
--	O
a	O
gentle	O
sorrow	O
--	O
but	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
any	O
disagreeable	O
consciousness.	O

--	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
married.	O

It	O
was	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
's	O
loss	O
which	O
first	O
brought	O
grief.	O

It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
wedding-day	O
of	O
this	O
beloved	O
friend	O
that	O
Emma	O
first	O
sat	O
in	O
mournful	O
thought	O
of	O
any	O
continuance.	O

The	O
wedding	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
bride-people	O
gone	O
,	O
her	O
father	O
and	O
herself	O
were	O
left	O
to	O
dine	O
together	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
prospect	O
of	O
a	O
third	O
to	O
cheer	O
a	O
long	O
evening.	O

Her	O
father	O
composed	O
himself	O
to	O
sleep	O
after	O
dinner	O
,	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
then	O
only	O
to	O
sit	O
and	O
think	O
of	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
lost.	O

The	O
event	O
had	O
every	O
promise	O
of	O
happiness	O
for	O
her	O
friend.	O

Mr.	O
Weston	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
unexceptionable	O
character	O
,	O
easy	O
fortune	O
,	O
suitable	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
pleasant	O
manners	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
considering	O
with	O
what	O
self-denying	O
,	O
generous	O
friendship	O
she	O
had	O
always	O
wished	O
and	O
promoted	O
the	O
match	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
black	O
morning	O
's	O
work	O
for	O
her.	O

The	O
want	O
of	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
would	O
be	O
felt	O
every	O
hour	O
of	O
every	O
day.	O

She	O
recalled	O
her	O
past	O
kindness	O
--	O
the	O
kindness	O
,	O
the	O
affection	O
of	O
sixteen	O
years	O
--	O
how	O
she	O
had	O
taught	O
and	O
how	O
she	O
had	O
played	O
with	O
her	O
from	O
five	O
years	O
old	O
--	O
how	O
she	O
had	O
devoted	O
all	O
her	O
powers	O
to	O
attach	O
and	O
amuse	O
her	O
in	O
health	O
--	O
and	O
how	O
nursed	O
her	O
through	O
the	O
various	O
illnesses	O
of	O
childhood.	O

A	O
large	O
debt	O
of	O
gratitude	O
was	O
owing	O
here	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
intercourse	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
seven	O
years	O
,	O
the	O
equal	O
footing	O
and	O
perfect	O
unreserve	O
which	O
had	O
soon	O
followed	O
Isabella	O
's	O
marriage	O
,	O
on	O
their	O
being	O
left	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
was	O
yet	O
a	O
dearer	O
,	O
tenderer	O
recollection.	O

She	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
friend	O
and	O
companion	O
such	O
as	O
few	O
possessed	O
:	O
intelligent	O
,	O
well-informed	O

in	O
herself	O

in	O
every	O
pleasure	O

every	O
scheme	O
of	O
hers	O
--	O
one	O
to	O
whom	O
she	O
could	O
speak	O
every	O
thought	O
as	O
it	O
arose	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
such	O
an	O
affection	O
for	O
her	O
as	O
could	O
never	O
find	O
fault.	O

How	O
was	O
she	O
to	O
bear	O
the	O
change	O
?	O

--	O
It	O
was	O
true	O
that	O
her	O
friend	O
was	O
going	O
only	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
Emma	O
was	O
aware	O
that	O
great	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
a	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
,	O
only	O
half	O

the	O
house	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
her	O
advantages	O
,	O
natural	O
and	O
domestic	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
now	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
of	O
suffering	O
from	O
intellectual	O
solitude.	O

She	O
dearly	O
loved	O
her	O
father	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
no	O
companion	O
for	O
her.	O

He	O
could	O
not	O
meet	O
her	O
in	O
conversation	O
,	O
rational	O
or	O

the	O

of	O
Mr.	O

Mrs.	O

Churchill	O
,	O
who	O
threw	O
her	O
off	O

It	O
was	O
an	O

did	O
not	O

Mrs.	O

Weston	O
ought	O
to	O

a	O
husband	O

warm	O
heart	O

made	O
him	O
think	O
every	O

for	O
the	O
great	O
goodness	O
of	O

though	O
she	O

she	O
had	O
not	O
the	O

She	O

in	O

nor	O
from	O

They	O
lived	O
beyond	O
their	O

but	O
still	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
in	O

of	O
Enscombe	O
:	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
cease	O
to	O

Captain	O

by	O
the	O

as	O

when	O
his	O

after	O

three	O

he	O
was	O

than	O

From	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

Some	O
scruples	O
and	O
some	O
reluctance	O
the	O
widower-father	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
felt	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
overcome	O
by	O

,	O
the	O
child	O
was	O
given	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
and	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
the	O
Churchills	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
only	O
his	O
own	O
comfort	O
to	O
seek	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
own	O
situation	O
to	O
improve	O
as	O
he	O
could.	O

A	O
complete	O
change	O
of	O
life	O
became	O
desirable.	O

He	O
quitted	O
the	O
militia	O
and	O
engaged	O
in	O
trade	O
,	O
having	O
brothers	O
already	O
established	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
in	O
London	O
,	O
which	O
afforded	O
him	O
a	O
favourable	O
opening.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
concern	O
which	O
brought	O
just	O
employment	O
enough.	O

He	O
had	O
still	O
a	O
small	O
house	O
in	O
Highbury	O
,	O
where	O
most	O
of	O
his	O
leisure	O
days	O
were	O
spent	O
;	O
and	O
between	O
useful	O
occupation	O
and	O
the	O
pleasures	O
of	O
society	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
eighteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
years	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
passed	O
cheerfully	O
away.	O

He	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
realised	O
an	O
easy	O
competence	O
--	O
enough	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
purchase	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
estate	O
adjoining	O
Highbury	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
always	O
longed	O
for	O
--	O
enough	O
to	O
marry	O
a	O
woman	O
as	O
portionless	O
even	O
as	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
live	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
wishes	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
friendly	O
and	O
social	O
disposition.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
some	O
time	O
since	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
had	O
begun	O
to	O
influence	O
his	O
schemes	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
tyrannic	O
influence	O
of	O
youth	O
on	O
youth	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
shaken	O
his	O
determination	O
of	O
never	O
settling	O
till	O
he	O
could	O
purchase	O
Randalls	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sale	O
of	O
Randalls	O
was	O
long	O
looked	O
forward	O
to	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
steadily	O
on	O
,	O
with	O
these	O
objects	O
in	O
view	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
accomplished.	O

He	O
had	O
made	O
his	O
fortune	O
,	O
bought	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
obtained	O
his	O
wife	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
beginning	O
a	O
new	O
period	O
of	O
existence	O
,	O
with	O
every	O
probability	O
of	O
greater	O
happiness	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
yet	O
passed	O
through.	O

He	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
an	O
unhappy	O
man	O
;	O
his	O
own	O
temper	O
had	O
secured	O
him	O
from	O
that	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
his	O
first	O
marriage	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
second	O
must	O
shew	O
him	O
how	O
delightful	O
a	O
well-judging	O
and	O
truly	O
amiable	O
woman	O
could	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
pleasantest	O
proof	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
better	O
to	O
choose	O
than	O
to	O
be	O
chosen	O
,	O
to	O
excite	O
gratitude	O
than	O
to	O
feel	O
it.	O

He	O
had	O
only	O
himself	O
to	O
please	O
in	O
his	O
choice	O
:	O
his	O
fortune	O
was	O
his	O
own	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
Frank	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
being	O
tacitly	O
brought	O
up	O
as	O
his	O
uncle	O
's	O
heir	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
become	O
so	O
avowed	O
an	O
adoption	O
as	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
assume	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Churchill	O
on	O
coming	O
of	O
age.	O

It	O
was	O
most	O
unlikely	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
ever	O
want	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
assistance.	O

His	O
father	O
had	O
no	O
apprehension	O
of	O
it.	O

The	O
aunt	O
was	O
a	O
capricious	O
woman	O
,	O
and	O
governed	O
her	O
husband	O
entirely	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Weston	O
's	O
nature	O
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
any	O
caprice	O
could	O
be	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
affect	O
one	O
so	O
dear	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
believed	O
,	O
so	O
deservedly	O
dear.	O

He	O
saw	O
his	O
son	O
every	O
year	O
in	O
London	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
proud	O
of	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
fond	O
report	O
of	O
him	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
young	O
man	O
had	O
made	O
Highbury	O
feel	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
pride	O
in	O
him	O
too.	O

He	O
was	O
looked	O
on	O
as	O
sufficiently	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
merits	O
and	O
prospects	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
common	O
concern.	O

Mr.	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boasts	O
of	O
Highbury	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
lively	O
curiosity	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
prevailed	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
compliment	O
was	O
so	O
little	O
returned	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
there	O
in	O
his	O
life.	O

His	O
coming	O
to	O
visit	O
his	O
father	O
had	O
been	O
often	O
talked	O
of	O
but	O
never	O
achieved.	O

Now	O
,	O
upon	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
marriage	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
generally	O
proposed	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
most	O
proper	O
attention	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
visit	O
should	O
take	O
place.	O

There	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
dissentient	O
voice	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
,	O
either	O
when	O
Mrs.	O

Perry	O
drank	O
tea	O
with	O
Mrs.	O

and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
,	O
or	O
when	O
Mrs.	O

and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
returned	O
the	O
visit.	O

Now	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
for	O
Mr.	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
to	O
come	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
hope	O
strengthened	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
understood	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
written	O
to	O
his	O
new	O
mother	O
on	O
the	O
occasion.	O

For	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
every	O
morning	O
visit	O
in	O
Highbury	O
included	O
some	O
mention	O
of	O
the	O
handsome	O
letter	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
had	O
received.	O

"	O
I	O
suppose	O
you	O
have	O

of	O

written	O

Mrs.	O

Weston	O

I	O
understand	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
letter	O

indeed.	O

Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
told	O
me	O
of	O
it.	O

Mr.	O

saw	O
the	O

had	O

a	O
very	O
favourable	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
young	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
such	O
a	O
pleasing	O
attention	O
was	O
an	O
irresistible	O
proof	O
of	O
his	O
great	O
good	O
sense	O

and	O
a	O
most	O
welcome	O
addition	O
to	O
every	O
source	O
and	O
every	O
expression	O
of	O
congratulation	O
which	O
her	O
marriage	O
had	O
already	O
secured.	O

She	O
felt	O
herself	O
a	O
most	O
fortunate	O
woman	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
lived	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
fortunate	O
she	O
might	O
well	O
be	O
thought	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
only	O
regret	O
was	O
for	O
a	O
partial	O
separation	O
from	O

whose	O
friendship	O
for	O

had	O
never	O
cooled	O

and	O
who	O
could	O
ill	O
bear	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
her.	O

She	O
knew	O
that	O
at	O
times	O
she	O
must	O
be	O

could	O

Emma	O
was	O
of	O
no	O

she	O
was	O

in	O
the	O
very	O

been	O
at	O
the	O
pains	O
of	O
consulting	O
Mr.	O
Perry	O
,	O
the	O
apothecary	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
subject.	O

Mr.	O
Perry	O
was	O
an	O
intelligent	O
,	O
gentlemanlike	O
man	O
,	O
whose	O
frequent	O
visits	O
were	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
comforts	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
being	O
applied	O
to	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
acknowledge	O
(	O
though	O
it	O
seemed	O
rather	O
against	O
the	O
bias	O
of	O
inclination	O
)	O
that	O
wedding-cake	O
might	O
certainly	O
disagree	O
with	O
many	O
--	O
perhaps	O
with	O
most	O
people	O
,	O
unless	O
taken	O
moderately.	O

With	O
such	O
an	O
opinion	O
,	O
in	O
confirmation	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
hoped	O
to	O
influence	O
every	O
visitor	O
of	O
the	O
newly	O
married	O
pair	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
the	O
cake	O
was	O
eaten	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
rest	O
for	O
his	O
benevolent	O
nerves	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
gone.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
strange	O
rumour	O
in	O
Highbury	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
little	O
Perrys	O
being	O
seen	O
with	O
a	O
slice	O
of	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
's	O
wedding-cake	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
:	O

Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
would	O
never	O
believe	O
it.	O

CHAPTER	O
III	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
was	O
fond	O
of	O
society	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
way.	O

He	O
liked	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
have	O
his	O
friends	O
come	O
and	O
see	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
various	O
united	O
causes	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
long	O
residence	O
at	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
good	O
nature	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
fortune	O
,	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
daughter	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
command	O
the	O
visits	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
little	O
circle	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
liked.	O

He	O
had	O
not	O
much	O
intercourse	O
with	O
any	O
families	O
beyond	O
that	O
circle	O
;	O
his	O
horror	O
of	O
late	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
dinner-parties	O
,	O
made	O
him	O
unfit	O
for	O
any	O
acquaintance	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
would	O
visit	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
terms.	O

Fortunately	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
Highbury	O
,	O
including	O
Randalls	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
parish	O
,	O
and	O
Donwell	O
Abbey	O
in	O
the	O
parish	O
adjoining	O
,	O
the	O
seat	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
,	O
comprehended	O
many	O
such.	O

Not	O
unfrequently	O
,	O
through	O
Emma	O
's	O
persuasion	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
chosen	O
and	O
the	O
best	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
him	O
:	O
but	O
evening	O
parties	O
were	O
what	O
he	O
preferred	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
unless	O
he	O
fancied	O
himself	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
unequal	O
to	O
company	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
scarcely	O
an	O
evening	O
in	O
the	O
week	O
in	O
which	O
Emma	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
up	O
a	O
card-table	O
for	O
him.	O

Real	O
,	O
long-standing	O
regard	O
brought	O
the	O
Westons	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Elton	O
,	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
living	O
alone	O
without	O
liking	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
privilege	O
of	O
exchanging	O
any	O
vacant	O
evening	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
blank	O
solitude	O
for	O
the	O
elegancies	O
and	O
society	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
drawing-room	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
smiles	O
of	O
his	O
lovely	O
daughter	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
no	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
thrown	O
away.	O

After	O
these	O
came	O
a	O
second	O
set	O
;	O
among	O
the	O
most	O
come-at-able	O
of	O
whom	O
were	O
Mrs.	O

and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
,	O
and	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
,	O
three	O
ladies	O
almost	O
always	O
at	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
an	O
invitation	O
from	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
were	O
fetched	O
and	O
carried	O
home	O
so	O
often	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
thought	O
it	O
no	O
hardship	O
for	O
either	O
James	O
or	O
the	O
horses.	O

Had	O
it	O
taken	O
place	O
only	O
once	O
a	O
year	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
grievance.	O

Mrs.	O

Bates	O
,	O
the	O
widow	O
of	O
a	O
former	O
vicar	O
of	O
Highbury	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
old	O
lady	O
,	O
almost	O
past	O
every	O
thing	O
but	O
tea	O
and	O
quadrille.	O

She	O
lived	O
with	O
her	O
single	O
daughter	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
considered	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
regard	O
and	O
respect	O
which	O
a	O
harmless	O
old	O
lady	O
,	O
under	O
such	O
untoward	O
circumstances	O
,	O
can	O
excite.	O

Her	O
daughter	O
enjoyed	O
a	O
most	O
uncommon	O
degree	O
of	O
popularity	O
for	O
a	O
woman	O
neither	O
young	O
,	O
handsome	O
,	O
rich	O
,	O
nor	O
married.	O

Miss	O
Bates	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
worst	O
predicament	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
for	O
having	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
favour	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
no	O
intellectual	O
superiority	O
to	O
make	O
atonement	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
or	O
frighten	O
those	O
who	O
might	O
hate	O
her	O
into	O
outward	O
respect.	O

She	O
had	O
never	O
boasted	O
either	O
beauty	O
or	O
cleverness.	O

Her	O
youth	O
had	O
passed	O
without	O
distinction	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
middle	O
of	O
life	O
was	O
devoted	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
a	O
failing	O
mother	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
endeavour	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
small	O
income	O
go	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
possible.	O

And	O
yet	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
happy	O
woman	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
woman	O
whom	O
no	O
one	O
named	O
without	O
good-will.	O

It	O
was	O
her	O
own	O
universal	O
good-will	O
and	O
contented	O
temper	O
which	O
worked	O
such	O
wonders.	O

She	O
loved	O
every	O
body	O
,	O
was	O
interested	O
in	O
every	O
body	O
's	O
happiness	O
,	O
quicksighted	O
to	O
every	O
body	O
's	O
merits	O
;	O
thought	O
herself	O
a	O
most	O
fortunate	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
surrounded	O
with	O
blessings	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
excellent	O
mother	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
many	O
good	O
neighbours	O
and	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
home	O
that	O
wanted	O
for	O
nothing.	O

The	O
simplicity	O
and	O
cheerfulness	O
of	O
her	O
nature	O
,	O
her	O
contented	O
and	O
grateful	O
spirit	O
,	O
were	O
a	O
recommendation	O
to	O
every	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
mine	O
of	O
felicity	O
to	O
herself.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
talker	O
upon	O
little	O
matters	O
,	O
which	O
exactly	O
suited	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
trivial	O
communications	O
and	O
harmless	O
gossip.	O

Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
was	O
the	O
mistress	O
of	O
a	O
School	O
--	O
not	O
of	O
a	O
seminary	O
,	O
or	O
an	O
establishment	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
thing	O
which	O
professed	O
,	O
in	O
long	O
sentences	O
of	O
refined	O
nonsense	O
,	O
to	O
combine	O
liberal	O
acquirements	O
with	O
elegant	O
morality	O
,	O
upon	O
new	O
principles	O
and	O
new	O
systems	O
--	O
and	O
where	O
young	O
ladies	O
for	O
enormous	O
pay	O
might	O
be	O
screwed	O
out	O
of	O
health	O
and	O
into	O
vanity	O
--	O
but	O
a	O
real	O
,	O
honest	O
,	O
old-fashioned	O
Boarding-school	O

where	O
a	O
reasonable	O
quantity	O
of	O
accomplishments	O
were	O
sold	O
at	O
a	O
reasonable	O
price	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
girls	O
might	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
scramble	O
themselves	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
education	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
danger	O
of	O
coming	O
back	O
prodigies.	O

Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
's	O
school	O
was	O
in	O
high	O
repute	O
--	O
and	O
very	O
deservedly	O
;	O
for	O
Highbury	O
was	O
reckoned	O
a	O
particularly	O
healthy	O
spot	O
:	O
she	O
had	O
an	O
ample	O
house	O
and	O
garden	O
,	O
gave	O
the	O
children	O
plenty	O
of	O
wholesome	O
food	O
,	O
let	O
them	O
run	O
about	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
winter	O
dressed	O
their	O
chilblains	O
with	O
her	O
own	O
hands.	O

It	O
was	O
no	O
wonder	O
that	O
a	O
train	O
of	O
twenty	O
young	O
couple	O
now	O
walked	O
after	O
her	O
to	O
church.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
plain	O
,	O
motherly	O
kind	O
of	O
woman	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
worked	O
hard	O
in	O
her	O
youth	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
thought	O
herself	O
entitled	O
to	O
the	O
occasional	O
holiday	O
of	O
a	O
tea-visit	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
formerly	O
owed	O
much	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
kindness	O
,	O
felt	O
his	O
particular	O
claim	O
on	O
her	O
to	O
leave	O
her	O
neat	O
parlour	O

hung	O
round	O
with	O
fancy-work	O

whenever	O

could	O

and	O
win	O
or	O
lose	O
a	O
few	O
sixpences	O
by	O
his	O
fireside.	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
ladies	O
whom	O
Emma	O
found	O
herself	O
very	O
frequently	O
able	O
to	O
collect	O
;	O
and	O
happy	O
was	O
she	O

for	O
her	O

;	O
though	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
she	O
was	O
herself	O
concerned	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
for	O
the	O
absence	O
of	O
Mrs.	O

Weston.	O

She	O
was	O
delighted	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
father	O
look	O
comfortable	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
herself	O
for	O
contriving	O
things	O
so	O
well	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
quiet	O
prosings	O
of	O
three	O
such	O
women	O
made	O
her	O
feel	O
that	O
every	O
evening	O
so	O
spent	O
was	O
indeed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
evenings	O
she	O
had	O
fearfully	O
anticipated.	O

As	O
she	O
sat	O
one	O
morning	O

looking	O
forward	O
to	O
exactly	O
such	O
a	O
close	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
day	O
,	O
a	O
note	O
was	O
brought	O
from	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
,	O
requesting	O

in	O
most	O
respectful	O

to	O
bring	O
Miss	O
Smith	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
a	O
most	O
welcome	O
request	O
:	O
for	O
Miss	O
Smith	O
was	O
a	O
girl	O
of	O
seventeen	O
,	O
whom	O
Emma	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
by	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
long	O
felt	O
an	O
interest	O
in	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
her	O
beauty.	O

A	O
very	O
gracious	O
invitation	O
was	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
evening	O
no	O
longer	O
dreaded	O
by	O
the	O
fair	O
mistress	O
of	O
the	O
mansion.	O

Harriet	O
Smith	O
was	O
the	O
natural	O
daughter	O
of	O
somebody.	O

Somebody	O
had	O
placed	O
her	O
,	O
several	O
years	O
back	O
,	O
at	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
's	O
school	O
,	O
and	O
somebody	O
had	O
lately	O
raised	O
her	O
from	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
scholar	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
parlour-boarder.	O

This	O
was	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
generally	O
known	O
of	O
her	O
history.	O

She	O
had	O
no	O
visible	O
friends	O
but	O
what	O
had	O
been	O
acquired	O
at	O
Highbury	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
now	O
just	O
returned	O
from	O
a	O
long	O
visit	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
some	O
young	O
ladies	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
school	O
there	O
with	O
her.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
girl	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
beauty	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
a	O
sort	O
which	O
Emma	O
particularly	O
admired.	O

She	O
was	O
short	O
,	O
plump	O
,	O
and	O
fair	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
bloom	O
,	O
blue	O
eyes	O
,	O
light	O
hair	O
,	O
regular	O
features	O

and	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
great	O
sweetness	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
Emma	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
her	O
manners	O
as	O
her	O
person	O
,	O
and	O
quite	O
determined	O
to	O
continue	O
the	O
acquaintance.	O

She	O
was	O
not	O
struck	O
by	O
any	O
thing	O
remarkably	O
clever	O
in	O
Miss	O
Smith	O
's	O
conversation	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
found	O
her	O
altogether	O
very	O
engaging	O
--	O
not	O
inconveniently	O
shy	O
,	O
not	O
unwilling	O
to	O
talk	O
--	O
and	O
yet	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
pushing	O
,	O
shewing	O
so	O
proper	O
and	O
becoming	O
a	O
deference	O
,	O
seeming	O
so	O
pleasantly	O
grateful	O
for	O
being	O
admitted	O
to	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
artlessly	O
impressed	O
by	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
every	O
thing	O
in	O
so	O
superior	O
a	O
style	O
to	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
must	O
have	O
good	O
sense	O
,	O
and	O
deserve	O
encouragement.	O

Encouragement	O
should	O
be	O
given.	O

Those	O
soft	O
blue	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
those	O
natural	O
graces	O
,	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
wasted	O
on	O
the	O
inferior	O
society	O
of	O
Highbury	O
and	O
its	O
connexions.	O

The	O
acquaintance	O
she	O
had	O
already	O
formed	O
were	O
unworthy	O
of	O
her.	O

The	O
friends	O
from	O
whom	O
she	O
had	O
just	O
parted	O

though	O
very	O
good	O
sort	O
of	O

Harriet	O

's	O
intimacy	O
at	O
Hartfield	O

soon	O
a	O

thing.	O

Quick	O
and	O
decided	O
in	O
her	O
ways	O

Emma	O
lost	O
no	O
time	O
in	O
inviting	O

,	O
and	O
telling	O
her	O
to	O
come	O
very	O
often	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
their	O
acquaintance	O
increased	O
,	O
so	O
did	O
their	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
each	O
other.	O

As	O
a	O
walking	O
companion	O
,	O
Emma	O
had	O
very	O
early	O
foreseen	O
how	O
useful	O
she	O
might	O
find	O
her.	O

In	O
that	O
respect	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
's	O
loss	O
had	O
been	O
important.	O

Her	O
father	O
never	O
went	O
beyond	O
the	O
shrubbery	O
,	O
where	O
two	O
divisions	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
sufficed	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
long	O
walk	O
,	O
or	O
his	O
short	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
year	O
varied	O
;	O
and	O
since	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
's	O
marriage	O
her	O
exercise	O
had	O
been	O
too	O
much	O
confined.	O

She	O
had	O
ventured	O
once	O
alone	O
to	O
Randalls	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
pleasant	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
Harriet	O
Smith	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
one	O
whom	O
she	O
could	O
summon	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
to	O
a	O
walk	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
valuable	O
addition	O
to	O
her	O
privileges.	O

But	O
in	O
every	O
respect	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
saw	O
more	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
approved	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
confirmed	O
in	O
all	O
her	O
kind	O
designs.	O

Harriet	O
certainly	O
was	O
not	O
clever	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
sweet	O
,	O
docile	O
,	O
grateful	O
disposition	O
,	O
was	O
totally	O
free	O
from	O
conceit	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
desiring	O
to	O
be	O
guided	O
by	O
any	O
one	O
she	O
looked	O
up	O
to.	O

Her	O
early	O
attachment	O
to	O
herself	O
was	O
very	O
amiable	O
;	O
and	O
her	O
inclination	O
for	O
good	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
power	O
of	O
appreciating	O
what	O
was	O
elegant	O
and	O
clever	O
,	O
shewed	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
want	O
of	O
taste	O
,	O
though	O
strength	O
of	O
understanding	O
must	O
not	O
be	O
expected.	O

Altogether	O
she	O
was	O
quite	O
convinced	O
of	O
Harriet	O
Smith	O
's	O
being	O
exactly	O
the	O
young	O
friend	O
she	O
wanted	O
--	O
exactly	O
the	O
something	O
which	O
her	O
home	O
required.	O

Such	O
a	O
friend	O

Mrs.	O

Weston	O
was	O
out	O

the	O
question.	O

Two	O
such	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
granted.	O

Two	O
such	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
want.	O

It	O
was	O
quite	O
a	O
different	O
sort	O
of	O
thing	O
,	O
a	O
sentiment	O
distinct	O
and	O
independent.	O

Mrs.	O

Weston	O
was	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
a	O
regard	O
which	O
had	O
its	O
basis	O
in	O
gratitude	O
and	O
esteem.	O

Harriet	O
would	O
be	O
loved	O
as	O
one	O
to	O
whom	O
she	O
could	O
be	O
useful.	O

For	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
;	O
for	O
Harriet	O
every	O
thing.	O

Her	O
first	O
attempts	O
at	O
usefulness	O
were	O
in	O
an	O
endeavour	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
who	O
were	O
the	O
parents	O
,	O
but	O
Harriet	O
could	O
not	O
tell.	O

She	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
tell	O
every	O
thing	O
in	O
her	O
power	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
questions	O
were	O

should	O
not	O

the	O

Harriet	O
had	O
no	O
penetration.	O

She	O
had	O
been	O
satisfied	O
to	O
hear	O
and	O
believe	O
just	O
what	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
chose	O
to	O
tell	O
her	O

and	O
looked	O

Mr.	O

looked	O

the	O

the	O

with	O
the	O

to	O
receive	O
her	O

in	O
the	O

The	O
coming	O
of	O
her	O
sister	O

;	O

during	O
the	O
ten	O
days	O
of	O
their	O

at	O
Hartfield	O
it	O
was	O
not	O

that	O
any	O

the	O
ways	O
of	O

the	O

quiet	O
manners	O

a	O
disposition	O
remarkably	O
amiable	O

affectionate	O
;	O
wrapt	O
up	O
in	O
her	O
family	O
;	O
a	O
devoted	O
wife	O
,	O
a	O
doating	O
mother	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
tenderly	O
attached	O
to	O
her	O
father	O
and	O
sister	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
these	O
higher	O
ties	O
,	O
a	O
warmer	O
love	O
might	O
have	O
seemed	O
impossible.	O

She	O
could	O
never	O
see	O
a	O
fault	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
them.	O

She	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
woman	O
of	O
strong	O
understanding	O
or	O
any	O
quickness	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
resemblance	O
of	O
her	O
father	O
,	O
she	O
inherited	O
also	O
much	O
of	O
his	O
constitution	O
;	O
was	O
delicate	O
in	O
her	O
own	O
health	O
,	O
over-careful	O
of	O
that	O
of	O
her	O
children	O
,	O
had	O
many	O
fears	O
and	O
many	O
nerves	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
as	O
fond	O
of	O
her	O
own	O
Mr.	O
Wingfield	O
in	O
town	O
as	O
her	O
father	O
could	O
be	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Perry.	O

They	O
were	O
alike	O
too	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
general	O
benevolence	O
of	O
temper	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
habit	O
of	O
regard	O
for	O
every	O
old	O
acquaintance.	O

Mr.	O
John	O
Knightley	O
was	O
a	O
tall	O
,	O
gentleman-like	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
clever	O
man	O
;	O
rising	O
in	O
his	O
profession	O
,	O
domestic	O
,	O
and	O
respectable	O
in	O
his	O
private	O
character	O
;	O
but	O
with	O
reserved	O
manners	O
which	O
prevented	O
his	O
being	O
generally	O
pleasing	O
;	O
and	O
capable	O
of	O
being	O
sometimes	O
out	O
of	O
humour.	O

He	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
ill-tempered	O
man	O
,	O
not	O
so	O
often	O
unreasonably	O
cross	O
as	O
to	O
deserve	O
such	O
a	O
reproach	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
temper	O
was	O
not	O
his	O
great	O
perfection	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
worshipping	O
wife	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
hardly	O
possible	O
that	O
any	O
natural	O
defects	O
in	O
it	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
increased.	O

The	O
extreme	O
sweetness	O
of	O
her	O
temper	O
must	O
hurt	O
his.	O

He	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
clearness	O
and	O
quickness	O
of	O
mind	O
which	O
she	O
wanted	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
could	O
sometimes	O
act	O
an	O
ungracious	O
,	O
or	O
say	O
a	O
severe	O
thing.	O

He	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
great	O
favourite	O
with	O
his	O
fair	O
sister-in-law.	O

Nothing	O
wrong	O
in	O
him	O
escaped	O
her.	O

She	O
was	O
quick	O
in	O
feeling	O
the	O
little	O
injuries	O
to	O
Isabella	O
,	O
which	O
Isabella	O
never	O
felt	O
herself.	O

Perhaps	O
she	O
might	O
have	O
passed	O
over	O
more	O
had	O
his	O
manners	O
been	O
flattering	O
to	O
Isabella	O
's	O
sister	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
only	O
those	O
of	O
a	O
calmly	O
kind	O
brother	O
and	O
friend	O
,	O
without	O
praise	O
and	O
without	O
blindness	O
;	O
but	O
hardly	O
any	O
degree	O
of	O
personal	O
compliment	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
her	O
regardless	O
of	O
that	O
greatest	O
fault	O
of	O
all	O
in	O
her	O
eyes	O
which	O
he	O
sometimes	O
fell	O
into	O
,	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
respectful	O
forbearance	O
towards	O
her	O
father.	O

There	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
always	O
the	O
patience	O
that	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
wished.	O

Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
peculiarities	O
and	O
fidgetiness	O
were	O
sometimes	O
provoking	O
him	O
to	O
a	O
rational	O
remonstrance	O
or	O
sharp	O
retort	O
equally	O
ill-bestowed.	O

It	O
did	O
not	O
often	O
happen	O
;	O
for	O
Mr.	O
John	O
Knightley	O
had	O
really	O
a	O
great	O
regard	O
for	O
his	O
father-in-law	O

and	O
generally	O
a	O
strong	O
sense	O
of	O
what	O

;	O

it	O
was	O
too	O
often	O

If	O

The	O

the	O

lay	O
at	O

was	O

Mr.	O

Emma	O
was	O
in	O

them	O
away	O

promptitude.	O

She	O
now	O

keep	O
Harriet	O
no	O

She	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
her	O
nearly	O

from	O
her	O

and	O
it	O
was	O

that	O

She	O
had	O
to	O
destroy	O
all	O
the	O

which	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
industriously	O

The	O

renewed	O
her	O
first	O
shame	O
--	O
and	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
Harriet	O

made	O
her	O
think	O
that	O
she	O
should	O
never	O

in	O
charity	O
with	O

again.	O

Harriet	O
bore	O
the	O
intelligence	O
very	O

blaming	O
nobody	O

in	O
every	O

opinion	O
of	O

must	O

with	O

Emma	O

in	O

Harriet	O
did	O
not	O
consider	O
herself	O
as	O
having	O
any	O

to	O
complain	O
of.	O

The	O
affection	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
man	O

Mr.	O

would	O
have	O
been	O

--	O
She	O
never	O

nobody	O
but	O
so	O
partial	O
and	O
kind	O
a	O

as	O
Miss	O
Woodhouse	O
would	O
have	O
thought	O
it	O
possible.	O

Her	O
tears	O
fell	O
abundantly	O

but	O
her	O
grief	O
was	O
so	O
truly	O
artless	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
dignity	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
it	O
more	O
respectable	O

Emma	O

her	O
with	O
all	O
her	O
heart	O
and	O
understanding	O
--	O
really	O
for	O
the	O
time	O
convinced	O
that	O
Harriet	O

the	O
superior	O
creature	O
of	O
the	O
two	O

and	O
that	O
to	O

than	O
all	O
that	O

It	O
was	O
rather	O
too	O
late	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
to	O
set	O
about	O
being	O
simple-minded	O

she	O
left	O
her	O
with	O
every	O

Mrs.	O

Weston	O
's	O
fears	O
were	O
justified	O
in	O
the	O
arrival	O

a	O
letter	O
of	O
excuse.	O

For	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
spared	O
,	O
to	O
his	O
"	O
very	O
great	O
mortification	O
and	O
regret	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
he	O
looked	O
forward	O
with	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O

to	O
Randalls	O
at	O
no	O

period.	O

"	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
was	O
exceedingly	O
disappointed	O
--	O
much	O
more	O
disappointed	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
than	O
her	O
husband	O
,	O
though	O
her	O
dependence	O
on	O
seeing	O
the	O
young	O

had	O
been	O
so	O
much	O
more	O
sober	O

soon	O
flies	O
over	O
the	O

begins	O
to	O
hope	O
again.	O

For	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
Mr.	O
Weston	O
was	O
surprized	O
and	O
sorry	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
perceive	O
that	O
Frank	O
's	O
coming	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
months	O
later	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
plan	O
;	O
better	O
time	O
of	O
year	O
;	O
better	O
weather	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
doubt	O
,	O
to	O
stay	O
considerably	O
longer	O
with	O
them	O
than	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
come	O
sooner.	O

These	O

rapidly	O
restored	O

Mrs.	O

Weston	O

The	O
acquaintance	O
at	O

had	O
no	O

to	O

out	O
of	O

as	O
might	O
naturally	O

was	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
announce	O
it	O
to	O
Mr.	O

of	O
the	O

in	O
keeping	O
him	O

She	O
then	O
proceeded	O
to	O

My	B-QUOTE
mother	I-QUOTE

very	I-QUOTE
trifling	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
--	I-QUOTE
just	I-QUOTE
nothing	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
all.	I-QUOTE

By	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
raising	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
saying	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE

then	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE

used	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
remarkable	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
hear	I-QUOTE
Jane	I-QUOTE
better	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
does	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

Jane	I-QUOTE
speaks	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
distinct	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

However	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
grandmama	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
deafer	I-QUOTE

she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE

;	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
saying	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE

my	I-QUOTE
mother	I-QUOTE
's	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE

it	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
full	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
since	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
here.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
long	I-QUOTE
without	I-QUOTE
seeing	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
telling	I-QUOTE
Mrs.	I-QUOTE

Cole	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
shall	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
make	I-QUOTE
enough	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
now.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Are	B-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
expecting	I-QUOTE
Miss	I-QUOTE
Fairfax	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Oh	B-QUOTE
yes	I-QUOTE

Indeed	B-QUOTE

very	I-QUOTE

pleasure.	I-QUOTE

"	O

Thank	B-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
kind.	I-QUOTE

Yes	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
next	I-QUOTE
week.	I-QUOTE

Every	I-QUOTE
body	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
surprized	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
body	I-QUOTE
says	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
same	I-QUOTE
obliging	I-QUOTE
things.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
sure	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
happy	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
friends	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
Highbury	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

Yes	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Friday	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
Saturday	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
because	I-QUOTE
Colonel	I-QUOTE
Campbell	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
wanting	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
carriage	I-QUOTE
himself	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
those	I-QUOTE
days.	I-QUOTE

So	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
send	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
whole	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
know.	I-QUOTE

Oh	I-QUOTE
yes	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Friday	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
Saturday	I-QUOTE
next.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
writes	I-QUOTE
about.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
reason	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
writing	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
rule	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
call	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
common	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
heard	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
next	I-QUOTE
Tuesday	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
Wednesday.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Yes	B-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
imagined.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
afraid	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
chance	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
hearing	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Miss	I-QUOTE
Fairfax	I-QUOTE
to-day.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
So	B-QUOTE
obliging	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

No	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
heard	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
particular	I-QUOTE
circumstance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE

soon.	I-QUOTE

My	I-QUOTE

delighted	I-QUOTE

three	I-QUOTE

Three	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

see	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
grown	I-QUOTE
thin	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
looking	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
poorly.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE

desired	I-QUOTE

usual	I-QUOTE
caution	I-QUOTE

no	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
mention	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

However	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
read	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
near	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
bad	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
fancied	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
make	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
light	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
does	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
imagine	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE

off	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE

If	I-QUOTE

not	I-QUOTE
get	I-QUOTE
well	I-QUOTE
soon	I-QUOTE

we	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE

a	O

question	O
to	O
answer	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
had	O
once	O
told	O
her	O
it	O
was	O
because	O
she	O

in	O
her	O
the	O
really	O
accomplished	O
young	O
woman	O

she	O

there	O
were	O
moments	O
of	O
self-examination	O
in	O

her.	O

she	O
did	O
not	O

how	O
it	O
was	O

there	O
was	O
such	O

whether	O
she	O

her	O

such	O
an	O
eternal	O
talker	O

she	O
was	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
fuss	O
with	O
by	O
every	O
body	O
!	O

--	O
and	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
always	O
imagined	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
intimate	O
--	O
because	O
their	O
ages	O
were	O
the	O

These	O
were	O
her	O

was	O
a	O
dislike	O

every	O

so	O
magnified	O
by	O

that	O

appearance	O

which	O
for	O
those	O
two	O

elegant	O

and	O
she	O
had	O
herself	O
the	O

value	O
for	O

Her	O
height	O
was	O
pretty	O

just	O
such	O
as	O
almost	O
every	O
body	O
would	O
think	O
tall	O

and	O
nobody	O
could	O
think	O
very	O
tall	O

her	O
figure	O

graceful	O
;	O
her	O
size	O
a	O
most	O
becoming	O
medium	O
,	O
between	O
fat	O

thin	O

though	O
a	O
slight	O
appearance	O
of	O

seemed	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
the	O

of	O

Emma	O
could	O
not	O

all	O
this	O

her	O
face	O

remembered	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
regular	O

it	O
was	O
very	O
pleasing	O

eyes	O
,	O
a	O
deep	O
grey	O

dark	O

the	O
skin	O

at	O

a	O
clearness	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
style	O
of	O
beauty	O

of	O
which	O
elegance	O
was	O
the	O
reigning	O
character	O

There	O

not	O
to	O

distinction	O

and	O
merit.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
she	O
sat	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
first	O
visit	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
Jane	O
Fairfax	O
with	O
twofold	O
complacency	O
;	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
pleasure	O
and	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
rendering	O
justice	O

was	O
determining	O
that	O

her	O

to	O
sink	O
from	O

how	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
live	O

it	O
seemed	O
impossible	O
to	O
feel	O
any	O
thing	O

compassion	O
and	O
respect	O
;	O

,	O
if	O
to	O
every	O

the	O

circumstance	O
of	O
an	O
attachment	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Dixon	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
so	O
naturally	O
started	O
to	O
herself.	O

In	O
that	O
case	O

nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
pitiable	O
or	O
more	O
honourable	O
than	O
the	O
sacrifices	O
she	O
had	O
resolved	O
on.	O

Emma	O
was	O
very	O
willing	O
now	O
to	O
acquit	O
her	O
of	O

seduced	O
Mr.	O
Dixon	O
's	O
actions	O
from	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
any	O
thing	O
mischievous	O
which	O
her	O
imagination	O
had	O
suggested	O
at	O
first.	O

If	O
it	O
were	O
love	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
simple	O
,	O
single	O

her	O
side	O

might	O
have	O
been	O
unconsciously	O
sucking	O
in	O
the	O
sad	O
poison	O

while	O
a	O
sharer	O
of	O
his	O
conversation	O
with	O
her	O
friend	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
best	O
,	O
the	O
purest	O
of	O
motives	O
,	O
might	O
now	O
be	O
denying	O
herself	O
this	O
visit	O
to	O
Ireland	O
,	O
and	O
resolving	O
to	O
divide	O
herself	O
effectually	O
from	O
him	O

soon	O

duty.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
Emma	O
left	O
her	O
with	O
such	O
softened	O
,	O
charitable	O
feelings	O
,	O
as	O
made	O
her	O
look	O
around	O
in	O
walking	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
lament	O
that	O
Highbury	O
afforded	O
no	O
young	O
man	O
worthy	O
of	O
giving	O
her	O
independence	O
;	O
nobody	O
that	O

Hartfield	I-QUOTE

A	O
week	O
had	O
not	O
passed	O
since	O
Miss	O
Hawkins	O
's	O
name	O
was	O
first	O
mentioned	O
in	O
Highbury	O

before	O
she	O
was	O

by	O

when	O
Mr.	O

himself	O
arrived	O
to	O
triumph	O
in	O
his	O
happy	O
prospects	O
,	O
and	O
circulate	O
the	O
fame	O
of	O
her	O
merits	O

there	O
was	O
very	O
little	O
more	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
do	O

than	O
to	O
tell	O
her	O
Christian	O
name	O

and	O
say	O
whose	O
music	O
she	O
principally	O
played.	O

Mr.	O
Elton	O
returned	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
happy	O
man.	O

He	O
had	O
gone	O
away	O
rejected	O
and	O
mortified	O
--	O
disappointed	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
sanguine	O
hope	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
what	O
appeared	O
to	O
him	O
strong	O
encouragement	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
only	O
losing	O
the	O
right	O
lady	O
,	O
but	O
finding	O
himself	O
debased	O
to	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
wrong	O
one.	O

He	O
had	O
gone	O
away	O
deeply	O
offended	O

came	O
back	O

another	O

under	O
such	O
circumstances	O
what	O
is	O
gained	O
always	O
is	O
to	O
what	O

He	O
came	O
back	O
gay	O
and	O
self-satisfied	O

eager	O
and	O
busy	O
,	O
caring	O
nothing	O

was	O
in	O

of	O
an	O

a	O
woman	O
of	O
10,000	O

or	O
thereabouts	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
gained	O
her	O
with	O
such	O

rapidity	O
--	O
the	O
first	O
hour	O
of	O
introduction	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
very	O
soon	O
followed	O
by	O
distinguishing	O
notice	O
;	O
the	O
history	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
to	O

Mrs.	O

with	O

the	O
lady	O
had	O

so	O

had	O
in	O
short	O

to	O

a	O
most	O
intelligible	O
phrase	O

been	O
so	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
vanity	O
and	O
prudence	O
were	O
equally	O
contented.	O

He	O
had	O
caught	O
both	O
substance	O
and	O
shadow	O
--	O
both	O
fortune	O
and	O
affection	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
just	O
the	O
happy	O
man	O
he	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
;	O
talking	O
only	O
of	O
himself	O

his	O

congratulated	O
--	O
ready	O

laughed	O
at	O
--	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
cordial	O
,	O
fearless	O

,	O
now	O
addressing	O
all	O
the	O
young	O
ladies	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
ago	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
cautiously	O
gallant.	O

The	O
wedding	O
was	O
no	O
distant	O
event	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
parties	O
had	O
only	O
themselves	O
to	O
please	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
but	O
the	O
necessary	O
preparations	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
Bath	O
again	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
general	O
expectation	O
,	O
which	O
a	O
certain	O
glance	O
of	O
Mrs.	O

Cole	O
's	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
contradict	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
next	O
entered	O
Highbury	O
he	O
would	O
bring	O
his	O
bride.	O

During	O
his	O
present	O
short	O
stay	O
,	O
Emma	O
had	O
barely	O
seen	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
feel	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
meeting	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
give	O
her	O
the	O
impression	O
of	O
his	O
not	O
being	O
improved	O
by	O
the	O
mixture	O
of	O
pique	O
and	O
pretension	O
,	O
now	O
spread	O
over	O
his	O
air.	O

She	O
was	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
beginning	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
wonder	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
ever	O
thought	O
him	O
pleasing	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
sight	O
was	O
so	O
inseparably	O
connected	O
with	O
some	O
very	O
disagreeable	O
feelings	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
except	O
in	O
a	O
moral	O
light	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
penance	O
,	O
a	O
lesson	O
,	O
a	O
source	O
of	O
profitable	O
humiliation	O
to	O
her	O
own	O
mind	O
,	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
thankful	O
to	O
be	O
assured	O
of	O
never	O
seeing	O
him	O
again.	O

She	O
wished	O
him	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
gave	O
her	O
pain	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
welfare	O
twenty	O
miles	O
off	O
would	O
administer	O
most	O
satisfaction.	O

The	O
pain	O
of	O
his	O
continued	O
residence	O
in	O
Highbury	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
must	O
certainly	O
be	O
lessened	O
by	O
his	O
marriage.	O

Many	O
vain	O
solicitudes	O
would	O
be	O
prevented	O
--	O
many	O
awkwardnesses	O
smoothed	O
by	O
it.	O

A	O
_Mrs._	O
_Elton_	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
excuse	O
for	O
any	O
change	O
of	O
intercourse	O
;	O
former	O
intimacy	O
might	O
sink	O
without	O
remark.	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
almost	O
beginning	O
their	O
life	O
of	O
civility	O
again.	O

Of	O
the	O
lady	O
,	O
individually	O
,	O
Emma	O
thought	O
very	O
little.	O

She	O
was	O
good	O
enough	O
for	O
Mr.	O
Elton	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
;	O
accomplished	O
enough	O
for	O
Highbury	O
--	O
handsome	O
enough	O
--	O
to	O
look	O
plain	O
,	O
probably	O
,	O
by	O
Harriet	O
's	O
side.	O

As	O
to	O
connexion	O
,	O
there	O
Emma	O
was	O
perfectly	O
easy	O
;	O
persuaded	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
all	O
his	O
own	O
vaunted	O
claims	O
and	O
disdain	O
of	O
Harriet	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
nothing.	O

On	O
that	O
article	O
,	O
truth	O
seemed	O
attainable.	O

_What_	O
she	O
was	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
uncertain	O
;	O
but	O
_who_	O
she	O
was	O
,	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
setting	O
aside	O
the	O
10,000	O
l.	O

,	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
at	O
all	O
Harriet	O
's	O
superior.	O

She	O
brought	O
no	O
name	O

no	O

no	O

Miss	O
Hawkins	O
was	O
the	O
youngest	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
daughters	O
of	O
a	O
Bristol	O
--	O
merchant	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
he	O
must	O
be	O
called	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
profits	O
of	O
his	O
mercantile	O
life	O
appeared	O
so	O
very	O
moderate	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
unfair	O
to	O
guess	O
the	O
dignity	O
of	O
his	O
line	O
of	O
trade	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
moderate	O
also.	O

Part	O
of	O
every	O
winter	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
spend	O
in	O
Bath	O
;	O
but	O
Bristol	O
was	O
her	O
home	O
,	O
the	O
very	O
heart	O
of	O
Bristol	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
father	O
and	O
mother	O
had	O
died	O
some	O
years	O

,	O
an	O
uncle	O
remained	O
--	O
in	O
the	O
law	O
line	O
--	O
nothing	O
more	O
distinctly	O
honourable	O
was	O
hazarded	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
than	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
law	O
line	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
him	O
the	O
daughter	O
had	O
lived.	O

Emma	O
guessed	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
drudge	O
of	O
some	O
attorney	O
,	O
and	O
too	O
stupid	O
to	O
rise.	O

And	O
all	O
the	O
grandeur	O
of	O
the	O
connexion	O
seemed	O
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
elder	O
sister	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
_very_	O
_well_	O
_married_	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
gentleman	O
in	O
a	O
_great_	O
_way_	O

near	O
Bristol	O

who	O
kept	O
two	O
carriages	O

That	O
was	O
the	O
wind-up	O
of	O
the	O
history	O
;	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
glory	O
of	O
Miss	O
Hawkins.	O

Could	O
she	O
but	O
have	O
given	O
Harriet	O
her	O
feelings	O
about	O
it	O
all	O
!	O

She	O
had	O
talked	O
her	O
into	O
love	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
alas	O
!	O

she	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
easily	O
to	O
be	O
talked	O
out	O
of	O
it.	O

The	O
charm	O
of	O
an	O
object	O
to	O
occupy	O
the	O
many	O
vacancies	O
of	O
Harriet	O
's	O
mind	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
talked	O
away.	O

He	O
might	O
be	O
superseded	O
by	O
another	O
;	O
he	O
certainly	O
would	O
indeed	O
;	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
clearer	O
;	O
even	O
a	O
Robert	O

would	O
have	O
been	O
sufficient	O
;	O
but	O
nothing	O
else	O
,	O
she	O
feared	O

cure	O
her.	O

Harriet	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
once	O
begun	O

would	O
be	O
always	O
in	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
poor	O
girl	O
!	O

she	O
was	O
considerably	O
worse	O
from	O
this	O
reappearance	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Elton.	O

She	O
was	O
always	O
having	O
a	O

Emma	O

him	O
only	O
once	O

two	O

every	O

Harriet	O

was	O
always	O
among	O
those	O
who	O
saw	O
no	O

Mr.	O

found	O
nothing	O

to	O

under	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O

lifted	O
into	O
the	O
butcher	O

when	O
they	O

the	O

the	O

the	O
sight	O
of	O

given	O
her	O
so	O
much	O
pleasure	O
the	O
autumn	O
before	O
,	O
was	O
beginning	O
to	O
revive	O
a	O
little	O
local	O
agitation	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
parted	O
,	O
Emma	O
observed	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
looking	O
around	O
with	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
fearful	O
curiosity	O
,	O
which	O
determined	O
her	O
not	O
to	O
allow	O
the	O
visit	O
to	O
exceed	O
the	O
proposed	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour.	O

She	O
went	O
on	O
herself	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
that	O
portion	O
of	O
time	O
to	O
an	O
old	O
servant	O
who	O
was	O
married	O
,	O
and	O
settled	O
in	O
Donwell.	O

The	O
quarter	O
of	O

brought	O
her	O

to	O
the	O
white	O

again	O

Miss	O
Smith	O
receiving	O

with	O
her	O
without	O

unattended	O
by	O
any	O
alarming	O
young	O
man.	O

came	O
solitarily	O
down	O

a	O
Miss	O
Martin	O
just	O
appearing	O
at	O
the	O

with	O
her	O

with	O
ceremonious	O
civility.	O

Harriet	O
could	O
not	O
very	O
soon	O
give	O
an	O
intelligible	O
account.	O

She	O
was	O
feeling	O
too	O
much	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
Emma	O
collected	O
from	O
her	O
enough	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
meeting	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
pain	O
it	O
was	O
creating.	O

She	O
had	O
seen	O
only	O
Mrs.	O

Martin	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
girls.	O

They	O
had	O
received	O
her	O
doubtingly	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
coolly	O
;	O
and	O
nothing	O
beyond	O
the	O
merest	O
commonplace	O
had	O
been	O
talked	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

just	O
at	O

when	O
Mrs.	O

had	O
brought	O
on	O
a	O
more	O
interesting	O
subject	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
warmer	O
manner.	O

In	O
that	O
very	O
room	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
measured	O
last	O
September	O
,	O
with	O
her	O
two	O

were	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

by	O
the	O
window.	O

when	O
the	O

and	O
all	O
was	O

of	O
the	O
visit	O

and	O
the	O
shortness	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
were	O
then	O
felt	O
to	O
be	O
decisive.	O

Fourteen	O
minutes	O
to	O
be	O

to	O
those	O
with	O
whom	O

Emma	O
could	O

it	O

feel	O
how	O
justly	O
they	O
might	O
resent	O
,	O
how	O
naturally	O
Harriet	O
must	O
suffer.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O

a	O

to	O

the	O

in	O
a	O

rank	O
of	O
life.	O

They	O
were	O
so	O

that	O
a	O

should	O

could	O

They	O
must	O
be	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O

resolved	O
on	O
going	O
home	O

it.	O

Her	O
mind	O
was	O
quite	O
sick	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Elton	O
and	O
the	O
Martins.	O

The	O
refreshment	O
of	O
Randalls	O
was	O
absolutely	O
necessary.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
good	O

manner	O
to	O
her	O

nothing	O
could	O
more	O
agreeably	O
denote	O
his	O
wish	O
of	O
considering	O
her	O
as	O
a	O

and	O
securing	O
her	O
affection.	O

And	O
there	O
was	O
time	O
enough	O
for	O
Emma	O
to	O
form	O
a	O
reasonable	O
judgment	O
,	O
as	O
their	O
visit	O
included	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
morning.	O

They	O
were	O
all	O
three	O
walking	O
about	O
together	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
two	O
--	O
first	O
round	O
the	O
shrubberies	O
of	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
in	O
Highbury.	O

He	O
was	O
delighted	O
with	O
every	O
thing	O
;	O
admired	O
Hartfield	O
sufficiently	O
for	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
ear	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
their	O
going	O
farther	O
was	O
resolved	O
on	O
,	O
confessed	O
his	O
wish	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
whole	O
village	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
matter	O
of	O
commendation	O
and	O
interest	O
much	O
oftener	O
than	O
Emma	O
could	O
have	O
supposed.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
objects	O
of	O
his	O
curiosity	O
spoke	O
very	O
amiable	O
feelings.	O

He	O
begged	O
to	O
be	O
shewn	O
the	O
house	O
which	O
his	O
father	O
had	O
lived	O
in	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
home	O
of	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
father	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
recollecting	O
that	O
an	O
old	O
woman	O
who	O
had	O
nursed	O
him	O
was	O
still	O
living	O
,	O
walked	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
her	O
cottage	O
from	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
in	O
some	O
points	O
of	O
pursuit	O
or	O
observation	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
positive	O
merit	O
,	O
they	O
shewed	O
,	O
altogether	O
,	O
a	O
good-will	O
towards	O
Highbury	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
very	O
like	O
a	O
merit	O
to	O
those	O
he	O
was	O
with.	O

Emma	O
watched	O
and	O
decided	O
,	O
that	O
with	O
such	O
feelings	O
as	O
were	O
now	O
shewn	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
fairly	O
supposed	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
ever	O
voluntarily	O
absenting	O
himself	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
acting	O
a	O

making	O
a	O
parade	O
of	O
insincere	O

;	O
and	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
certainly	O
had	O
not	O
done	O
him	O
justice.	O

Their	O
first	O
pause	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
Crown	O
Inn	O
,	O
an	O
inconsiderable	O
house	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
principal	O
one	O
of	O

where	O
a	O

were	O
kept	O

more	O
for	O

such	O
brilliant	O

and	O
now	O
the	O
highest	O
purpose	O
for	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
ever	O
wanted	O
was	O
to	O
accommodate	O
a	O
whist	O
club	O
established	O
among	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
and	O
half-gentlemen	O
of	O
the	O
place.	O

was	O
immediately	O

him	O

and	O
instead	O

stopt	O
for	O
several	O
minutes	O
at	O
the	O
two	O
superior	O
sashed	O
windows	O
which	O
were	O
open	O

to	O
look	O
in	O

contemplate	O
its	O
capabilities	O
,	O
and	O
lament	O
that	O
its	O
original	O
purpose	O
should	O
have	O
ceased.	O

He	O
saw	O
no	O
fault	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
acknowledge	O
none	O
which	O
they	O
suggested.	O

No	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
long	O
enough	O
,	O

,	O

enough.	O

It	O
would	O
hold	O
the	O

They	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
balls	O
there	O
at	O

every	O
fortnight	O
through	O
the	O
winter.	O

Why	O

was	O
not	O

He	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
persuaded	O
that	O
so	O
many	O
good-looking	O
houses	O
as	O
he	O
saw	O
around	O
him	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
furnish	O

for	O
such	O
a	O
meeting	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
when	O

were	O

was	O
still	O
unwilling	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
the	O
inconvenience	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
mixture	O
would	O
be	O
any	O

that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
the	O

in	O
every	O
body	O
's	O
returning	O
into	O
their	O
proper	O
place	O
the	O
next	O
morning.	O

He	O
argued	O
like	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
very	O
much	O
bent	O
on	O
dancing	O
;	O
and	O
Emma	O
was	O
rather	O
surprized	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
Weston	O
prevail	O
so	O
decidedly	O
against	O
the	O
habits	O
of	O
the	O
Churchills.	O

He	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
all	O
the	O
life	O
and	O
spirit	O
,	O
cheerful	O
feelings	O
,	O
and	O
social	O
inclinations	O
of	O
his	O

and	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
Enscombe.	O

Of	O
pride	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
scarcely	O
enough	O
;	O
his	O
indifference	O
to	O
a	O
confusion	O
of	O
rank	O
,	O
bordered	O
too	O
much	O
on	O
inelegance	O
of	O
mind.	O

He	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
judge	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
evil	O
he	O
was	O
holding	O
cheap.	O

It	O
was	O
but	O
an	O
effusion	O
of	O
lively	O
spirits.	O

At	O

he	O
was	O
persuaded	O
to	O
move	O
on	O
from	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
Crown	O

being	O

obliging	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
sure	I-QUOTE

by	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
manner	I-QUOTE

it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE

Indeed	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
delightful	I-QUOTE
apples	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
Mrs.	I-QUOTE

Wallis	I-QUOTE
does	I-QUOTE

only	I-QUOTE

twice	I-QUOTE

Mr.	I-QUOTE

will	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE

very	I-QUOTE
finest	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
sends	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE

every	I-QUOTE
year	I-QUOTE

and	I-QUOTE
certainly	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE

keeping	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

My	I-QUOTE
mother	I-QUOTE
says	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
orchard	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
famous	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
younger	I-QUOTE
days.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
shocked	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
day	I-QUOTE
--	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
Mr.	I-QUOTE
Knightley	I-QUOTE
called	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
morning	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
Jane	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
eating	I-QUOTE
these	I-QUOTE
apples	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
talked	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
enjoyed	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
asked	I-QUOTE
whether	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
got	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
end	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
stock.	I-QUOTE

'I	O

he	I-QUOTE

'and	O
I	O

I	I-QUOTE

for	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
ours	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
gone	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
absolutely	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
many	I-QUOTE
left	I-QUOTE
--	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE

half	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
dozen	I-QUOTE
indeed	I-QUOTE

but	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE

for	I-QUOTE
Jane	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
bear	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE

sending	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE

so	I-QUOTE
liberal	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
already	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
Jane	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
same.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
gone	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
quarrelled	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
--	I-QUOTE
No	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE
quarrelled	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
quarrel	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
lives	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
distressed	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
owned	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
apples	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
nearly	I-QUOTE
gone	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
wished	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
believe	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
many	I-QUOTE
left.	I-QUOTE

Oh	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
dear	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
could.	I-QUOTE

However	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
same	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
William	I-QUOTE
Larkins	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
large	I-QUOTE
basket	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
apples	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
same	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
apples	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
bushel	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
obliged	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
went	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
spoke	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
William	I-QUOTE
Larkins	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
may	I-QUOTE
suppose.	I-QUOTE

William	I-QUOTE
Larkins	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
acquaintance	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
glad	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
however	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
afterwards	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
Patty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
William	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE

_that_	I-QUOTE

them	I-QUOTE

now	I-QUOTE

master	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
left	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
bake	I-QUOTE

William	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
seem	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
mind	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
himself	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
pleased	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE

had	I-QUOTE
sold	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
many	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
William	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
thinks	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
master	I-QUOTE
's	I-QUOTE
profit	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
Mrs.	I-QUOTE

Hodges	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
displeased	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
sent	I-QUOTE
away.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
bear	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
master	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
able	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
another	I-QUOTE
apple-tart	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
spring.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
Patty	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
bid	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
mind	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE

be	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

and	B-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE

we	I-QUOTE
shall	I-QUOTE
explore	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
dare	I-QUOTE
say.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
barouche-landau	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
holds	I-QUOTE
four	I-QUOTE

any	I-QUOTE

of	I-QUOTE
_our_	I-QUOTE

should	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
able	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
explore	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
different	I-QUOTE
beauties	I-QUOTE
extremely	I-QUOTE
well.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE

at	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE

Indeed	I-QUOTE

when	I-QUOTE

VOLUME	O
III	O
CHAPTER	O
I	O
A	O
very	O
little	O
quiet	O
reflection	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
satisfy	O
Emma	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
her	O
agitation	O
on	O
hearing	O
this	O
news	O
of	O
Frank	O
Churchill.	O

She	O
was	O
soon	O
convinced	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
for	O
herself	O
she	O
was	O
feeling	O
at	O
all	O
apprehensive	O
or	O
embarrassed	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
him.	O

Her	O
own	O
attachment	O
had	O
really	O
subsided	O
into	O
a	O
mere	O
nothing	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
worth	O
thinking	O
of	O
;	O
--	O
but	O
if	O
he	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
undoubtedly	O
been	O
always	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
most	O
in	O
love	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
,	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
returning	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
warmth	O
of	O
sentiment	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
away	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
distressing.	O

If	O
a	O
separation	O
of	O
two	O
months	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
cooled	O
him	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
dangers	O
and	O
evils	O
before	O
her	O
:	O
--	O
caution	O
for	O
him	O
and	O
for	O
herself	O
would	O
be	O
necessary.	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
mean	O
to	O
have	O
her	O
own	O
affections	O
entangled	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
incumbent	O
on	O
her	O
to	O
avoid	O
any	O
encouragement	O
of	O
his.	O

She	O
wished	O
she	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
keep	O
him	O
from	O
an	O
absolute	O
declaration.	O

That	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
very	O
painful	O
a	O
conclusion	O
of	O
their	O
present	O
acquaintance	O
!	O

and	O
yet	O
,	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
rather	O
anticipating	O
something	O
decisive.	O

She	O
felt	O
as	O
if	O
the	O
spring	O
would	O
not	O
pass	O
without	O
bringing	O
a	O
crisis	O
,	O
an	O
event	O
,	O
a	O
something	O
to	O
alter	O
her	O
present	O
composed	O
and	O
tranquil	O
state.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
long	O
,	O
though	O
rather	O
longer	O
than	O
Mr.	O
Weston	O
had	O
foreseen	O
,	O
before	O
she	O
had	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
forming	O
some	O
opinion	O
of	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
's	O
feelings.	O

The	O
Enscombe	O
family	O
were	O
not	O
in	O
town	O
quite	O
so	O
soon	O
as	O
had	O
been	O
imagined	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
Highbury	O
very	O
soon	O
afterwards.	O

He	O
rode	O
down	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
hours	O
;	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
yet	O
do	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
he	O
came	O
from	O
Randalls	O
immediately	O
to	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
she	O
could	O
then	O
exercise	O
all	O
her	O
quick	O
observation	O
,	O
and	O
speedily	O
determine	O
how	O
he	O
was	O
influenced	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
she	O
must	O
act.	O

They	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
friendliness.	O

There	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
his	O
great	O
pleasure	O
in	O
seeing	O
her.	O

But	O
she	O
had	O
an	O
almost	O
instant	O
doubt	O
of	O
his	O
caring	O
for	O
her	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
of	O
his	O
feeling	O
the	O
same	O
tenderness	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
degree.	O

She	O
watched	O
him	O
well.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
clear	O
thing	O
he	O
was	O
less	O
in	O
love	O
than	O
he	O
had	O
been.	O

Absence	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
conviction	O
probably	O
of	O
her	O
indifference	O
,	O
had	O
produced	O
this	O
very	O
natural	O
and	O
very	O
desirable	O
effect.	O

He	O
was	O
in	O
high	O
spirits	O
;	O
as	O
ready	O
to	O
talk	O
and	O
laugh	O
as	O
ever	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
delighted	O
to	O
speak	O
of	O
his	O
former	O
visit	O
,	O
and	O
recur	O
to	O
old	O
stories	O
:	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
agitation.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
his	O
calmness	O
that	O
she	O
read	O
his	O
comparative	O
difference.	O

He	O
was	O
not	O
calm	O
;	O
his	O
spirits	O
were	O
evidently	O
fluttered	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
restlessness	O
about	O
him.	O

Lively	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
a	O
liveliness	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
satisfy	O
himself	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
decided	O
her	O
belief	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
,	O
was	O
his	O
staying	O
only	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
hurrying	O
away	O
to	O
make	O
other	O
calls	O
in	O
Highbury.	O

"	O
He	O
had	O
seen	O
a	O
group	O
of	O
old	O
acquaintance	O
in	O
the	O
street	O
as	O
he	O
passed	O
--	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
stopped	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
stop	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
word	O
--	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
vanity	O
to	O
think	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
disappointed	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
call	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
wished	O
to	O
stay	O
longer	O
at	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
he	O
must	O
hurry	O
off.	O

"	O
She	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
being	O
less	O
in	O
love	O
--	O
but	O
neither	O
his	O
agitated	O
spirits	O
,	O
nor	O
his	O
hurrying	O
away	O
,	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
perfect	O
cure	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
was	O
rather	O
inclined	O
to	O
think	O
it	O
implied	O
a	O
dread	O
of	O
her	O
returning	O
power	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
discreet	O
resolution	O
of	O
not	O
trusting	O
himself	O
with	O
her	O
long.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
visit	O
from	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
ten	O
days.	O

He	O
was	O
often	O
hoping	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
come	O
--	O
but	O
was	O
always	O
prevented.	O

His	O
aunt	O
could	O
not	O
bear	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
leave	O
her.	O

Such	O
was	O
his	O
own	O
account	O
at	O
Randall's.	O

If	O
he	O
were	O
quite	O
sincere	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
really	O
tried	O
to	O
come	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
inferred	O
that	O
Mrs.	O

Churchill	O
's	O
removal	O
to	O
London	O
had	O
been	O
of	O
no	O
service	O
to	O
the	O
wilful	O
or	O
nervous	O
part	O
of	O
her	O
disorder.	O

That	O
she	O
was	O
really	O
ill	O
was	O
very	O
certain	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
declared	O
himself	O
convinced	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
at	O
Randalls.	O

Though	O
much	O
might	O
be	O
fancy	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
doubt	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
looked	O
back	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
weaker	O
state	O
of	O
health	O
than	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
half	O
a	O
year	O
ago.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
believe	O
it	O
to	O
proceed	O
from	O
any	O
thing	O
that	O
care	O
and	O
medicine	O
might	O
not	O
remove	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
that	O
she	O
might	O
not	O
have	O
many	O
years	O
of	O
existence	O
before	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
prevailed	O
on	O
,	O
by	O
all	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
doubts	O
,	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
her	O
complaints	O
were	O
merely	O
imaginary	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
as	O
strong	O
as	O
ever.	O

It	O
soon	O
appeared	O
that	O
London	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
place	O
for	O
her.	O

She	O
could	O
not	O
endure	O
its	O
noise.	O

Her	O
nerves	O
were	O
under	O
continual	O
irritation	O
and	O
suffering	O
;	O
and	O

the	O
ten	O
days	O
'	O
end	O
,	O
her	O
nephew	O

communicated	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
plan.	O

They	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
remove	O
immediately	O
to	O
Richmond.	O

Mrs.	O

Churchill	O
had	O
been	O
recommended	O
to	O
the	O
medical	O
skill	O
of	O
an	O
eminent	O
person	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
otherwise	O
a	O
fancy	O
for	O
the	O
place.	O

A	O
ready-furnished	O
house	O
in	O
a	O
favourite	O
spot	O
was	O
engaged	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
benefit	O
expected	O
from	O
the	O
change.	O

Emma	O
heard	O
that	O
Frank	O
wrote	O
in	O
the	O
highest	O
spirits	O
of	O
this	O
arrangement	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
most	O
fully	O
to	O
appreciate	O
the	O
blessing	O
of	O
having	O
two	O
months	O
before	O
him	O
of	O
such	O
near	O
neighbourhood	O
to	O
many	O
dear	O
friends	O
--	O
for	O
the	O
house	O
was	O
taken	O
for	O
May	O
and	O
June.	O

She	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
now	O
he	O
wrote	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
confidence	O
of	O
being	O
often	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
almost	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
even	O
wish.	O

Emma	O
saw	O
how	O
Mr.	O
Weston	O
understood	O
these	O
joyous	O
prospects.	O

He	O
was	O
considering	O
her	O
as	O
the	O
source	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
happiness	O
they	O
offered.	O

She	O
hoped	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
so.	O

Two	O
months	O
must	O
bring	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
proof.	O

Mr.	O
Weston	O
's	O
own	O
happiness	O
was	O
indisputable.	O

He	O
was	O
quite	O
delighted.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
very	O
circumstance	O
he	O
could	O
have	O
wished	O
for.	O

Now	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
really	O
having	O
Frank	O
in	O
their	O
neighbourhood.	O

What	O
were	O
nine	O
miles	O
to	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
?	O

--	O
An	O
hour	O
's	O
ride.	O

He	O
would	O
be	O
always	O
coming	O
over.	O

The	O
difference	O
in	O
that	O
respect	O
of	O
Richmond	O
and	O
London	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
whole	O
difference	O
of	O
seeing	O
him	O
always	O
and	O
seeing	O
him	O
never.	O

Sixteen	O
miles	O

nay	O

eighteen	O

must	O
be	O
full	O
eighteen	O

a	O
serious	O
obstacle.	O

Were	O
he	O
ever	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
away	O

the	O
day	O
would	O
be	O

She	O
liked	O
his	O

but	O
a	O
little	O
less	O
of	O

would	O

a	O
higher	O
character.	O

CHAPTER	O
III	O
This	O
little	O
explanation	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
gave	O
Emma	O
considerable	O
pleasure.	O

It	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
agreeable	O
recollections	O
of	O
the	O
ball	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
walked	O
about	O
the	O
lawn	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
to	O
enjoy.	O

--	O
She	O
was	O
extremely	O
glad	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
come	O
to	O
so	O
good	O
an	O
understanding	O
respecting	O
the	O
Eltons	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
their	O
opinions	O
of	O
both	O
husband	O
and	O
wife	O
were	O
so	O
much	O
alike	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
praise	O
of	O
Harriet	O
,	O
his	O
concession	O
in	O
her	O
favour	O
,	O
was	O
peculiarly	O
gratifying.	O

The	O
impertinence	O
of	O
the	O
Eltons	O
,	O
which	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
had	O
threatened	O
to	O
ruin	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
her	O
evening	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
its	O
highest	O
satisfactions	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
looked	O
forward	O
to	O
another	O
happy	O
result	O
--	O
the	O
cure	O
of	O
Harriet	O
's	O
infatuation.	O

--	O
From	O
Harriet	O
's	O
manner	O
of	O
speaking	O
of	O
the	O
circumstance	O
before	O
they	O
quitted	O
the	O
ballroom	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
strong	O
hopes.	O

It	O
seemed	O
as	O
if	O
her	O
eyes	O
were	O
suddenly	O
opened	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
were	O
enabled	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Elton	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
superior	O
creature	O
she	O
had	O
believed	O
him.	O

The	O
fever	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
Emma	O
could	O
harbour	O
little	O
fear	O
of	O
the	O
pulse	O
being	O
quickened	O
again	O
by	O
injurious	O
courtesy.	O

She	O
depended	O
on	O
the	O
evil	O
feelings	O
of	O
the	O
Eltons	O
for	O
supplying	O
all	O
the	O
discipline	O
of	O
pointed	O
neglect	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
farther	O
requisite.	O

--	O
Harriet	O
rational	O
,	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
not	O
too	O
much	O
in	O
love	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
not	O
wanting	O
to	O
quarrel	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
how	O
very	O
happy	O
a	O
summer	O
must	O
be	O
before	O
her	O
!	O

She	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
see	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
this	O
morning.	O

He	O
had	O
told	O
her	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
allow	O
himself	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
stopping	O
at	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
home	O
by	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
day.	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
regret	O
it.	O

Having	O
arranged	O
all	O
these	O
matters	O
,	O
looked	O
them	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
rights	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
just	O
turning	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
with	O
spirits	O
freshened	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
demands	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
little	O
boys	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
of	O
their	O
grandpapa	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
great	O
iron	O
sweep-gate	O
opened	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
persons	O
entered	O
whom	O
she	O
had	O
never	O
less	O
expected	O
to	O
see	O
together	O
--	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
,	O
with	O
Harriet	O
leaning	O
on	O
his	O
arm	O
--	O
actually	O
Harriet	O
!	O

--	O
A	O
moment	O
sufficed	O
to	O
convince	O
her	O
that	O
something	O
extraordinary	O
had	O
happened.	O

Harriet	O
looked	O
white	O
and	O
frightened	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
cheer	O
her.	O

--	O
The	O
iron	O
gates	O
and	O
the	O
front-door	O
were	O
not	O
twenty	O
yards	O
asunder	O
;	O
--	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
three	O
soon	O
in	O
the	O
hall	O
,	O
and	O
Harriet	O
immediately	O
sinking	O
into	O
a	O
chair	O
fainted	O
away.	O

A	O
young	O
lady	O
who	O
faints	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
recovered	O
;	O
questions	O
must	O
be	O
answered	O
,	O
and	O
surprizes	O
be	O
explained.	O

Such	O
events	O
are	O
very	O
interesting	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
suspense	O
of	O
them	O
can	O
not	O
last	O
long.	O

A	O
few	O
minutes	O
made	O
Emma	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
whole.	O

Miss	O
Smith	O
,	O
and	O
Miss	O
Bickerton	O
,	O
another	O
parlour	O
boarder	O
at	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
's	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
also	O
at	O
the	O
ball	O
,	O
had	O
walked	O
out	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
a	O
road	O
,	O
the	O
Richmond	O
road	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
apparently	O
public	O
enough	O
for	O
safety	O
,	O
had	O
led	O
them	O
into	O
alarm.	O

--	O
About	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
beyond	O
Highbury	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
sudden	O
turn	O
,	O
and	O
deeply	O
shaded	O
by	O
elms	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
,	O
it	O
became	O
for	O
a	O
considerable	O
stretch	O
very	O
retired	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
young	O
ladies	O
had	O
advanced	O
some	O
way	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
suddenly	O
perceived	O
at	O
a	O
small	O
distance	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
broader	O
patch	O
of	O
greensward	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
,	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
gipsies.	O

A	O
child	O
on	O
the	O
watch	O
,	O
came	O
towards	O
them	O
to	O
beg	O
;	O
and	O
Miss	O
Bickerton	O
,	O
excessively	O
frightened	O
,	O
gave	O
a	O
great	O
scream	O
,	O
and	O
calling	O
on	O
Harriet	O
to	O
follow	O
her	O
,	O
ran	O
up	O
a	O
steep	O
bank	O
,	O
cleared	O
a	O
slight	O
hedge	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
her	O
way	O
by	O
a	O
short	O
cut	O
back	O
to	O
Highbury.	O

But	O
poor	O
Harriet	O
could	O
not	O
follow.	O

She	O
had	O
suffered	O
very	O
much	O
from	O
cramp	O
after	O
dancing	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
first	O
attempt	O
to	O
mount	O
the	O
bank	O
brought	O
on	O
such	O
a	O
return	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
made	O
her	O
absolutely	O
powerless	O
--	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
state	O
,	O
and	O
exceedingly	O
terrified	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
remain.	O

How	O
the	O
trampers	O
might	O
have	O
behaved	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
young	O
ladies	O
been	O
more	O
courageous	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
doubtful	O
;	O
but	O
such	O
an	O
invitation	O
for	O
attack	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
resisted	O
;	O
and	O
Harriet	O
was	O
soon	O
assailed	O
by	O
half	O
a	O
dozen	O
children	O
,	O
headed	O
by	O
a	O
stout	O
woman	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
boy	O
,	O
all	O
clamorous	O
,	O
and	O
impertinent	O
in	O
look	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
absolutely	O
in	O
word.	O

--	O
More	O
and	O
more	O
frightened	O
,	O
she	O
immediately	O
promised	O
them	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
out	O
her	O
purse	O
,	O
gave	O
them	O
a	O
shilling	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
want	O
more	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
use	O
her	O
ill.	O

--	O
She	O
was	O
then	O
able	O
to	O
walk	O
,	O
though	O
but	O
slowly	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
moving	O
away	O
--	O
but	O
her	O
terror	O
and	O
her	O
purse	O
were	O
too	O
tempting	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
was	O
followed	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
surrounded	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O
gang	O
,	O
demanding	O
more.	O

In	O
this	O
state	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
had	O
found	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
trembling	O
and	O
conditioning	O
,	O
they	O
loud	O
and	O
insolent.	O

By	O
a	O
most	O
fortunate	O
chance	O
his	O
leaving	O
Highbury	O
had	O
been	O
delayed	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
bring	O
him	O
to	O
her	O
assistance	O
at	O
this	O
critical	O
moment.	O

The	O
pleasantness	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
had	O
induced	O
him	O
to	O
walk	O
forward	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
his	O
horses	O
to	O
meet	O
him	O
by	O
another	O
road	O
,	O
a	O
mile	O
or	O
two	O
beyond	O
Highbury	O
--	O
and	O
happening	O
to	O
have	O
borrowed	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
scissors	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
of	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
forgotten	O
to	O
restore	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
stop	O
at	O
her	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
therefore	O
later	O
than	O
he	O
had	O
intended	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
on	O
foot	O
,	O
was	O
unseen	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O
party	O
till	O
almost	O
close	O
to	O
them.	O

The	O
terror	O
which	O
the	O
woman	O
and	O
boy	O
had	O
been	O
creating	O
in	O
Harriet	O
was	O
then	O
their	O
own	O
portion.	O

He	O
had	O
left	O
them	O
completely	O
frightened	O
;	O
and	O
Harriet	O
eagerly	O
clinging	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
hardly	O
able	O
to	O
speak	O
,	O
had	O
just	O
strength	O
enough	O
to	O
reach	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
before	O
her	O
spirits	O
were	O
quite	O
overcome.	O

It	O
was	O
his	O
idea	O
to	O
bring	O
her	O
to	O
Hartfield	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
thought	O
of	O
no	O
other	O
place.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
story	O
,	O
--	O
of	O
his	O
communication	O
and	O
of	O
Harriet	O
's	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
recovered	O
her	O
senses	O
and	O
speech.	O

--	O
He	O
dared	O
not	O
stay	O
longer	O
than	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
well	O
;	O
these	O
several	O
delays	O
left	O
him	O
not	O
another	O
minute	O
to	O
lose	O
;	O
and	O
Emma	O
engaging	O
to	O
give	O
assurance	O
of	O
her	O
safety	O
to	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
,	O
and	O
notice	O
of	O
there	O
being	O
such	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
,	O
he	O
set	O
off	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
grateful	O
blessings	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
utter	O
for	O
her	O
friend	O
and	O
herself.	O

Such	O
an	O
adventure	O
as	O
this	O
,	O
--	O
a	O
fine	O
young	O
man	O
and	O
a	O
lovely	O
young	O
woman	O
thrown	O
together	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
way	O
,	O
could	O
hardly	O
fail	O
of	O
suggesting	O
certain	O
ideas	O
to	O
the	O
coldest	O
heart	O
and	O
the	O
steadiest	O
brain.	O

So	O
Emma	O
thought	O
,	O
at	O
least.	O

Could	O
a	O
linguist	O
,	O
could	O
a	O
grammarian	O
,	O
could	O
even	O
a	O
mathematician	O
have	O
seen	O
what	O
she	O
did	O
,	O
have	O
witnessed	O
their	O
appearance	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
their	O
history	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
without	O
feeling	O
that	O
circumstances	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
work	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
peculiarly	O
interesting	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
?	O

--	O
How	O
much	O
more	O
must	O
an	O
imaginist	O
,	O
like	O
herself	O
,	O
be	O
on	O
fire	O
with	O
speculation	O
and	O
foresight	O
!	O

--	O
especially	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
groundwork	O
of	O
anticipation	O
as	O
her	O
mind	O
had	O
already	O
made.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
extraordinary	O
thing	O
!	O

Nothing	O
of	O
the	O
sort	O
had	O
ever	O
occurred	O
before	O
to	O
any	O
young	O
ladies	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
within	O
her	O
memory	O
;	O
no	O
rencontre	O
,	O
no	O
alarm	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
;	O
--	O
and	O
now	O
it	O
had	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
person	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
hour	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
other	O
very	O
person	O
was	O
chancing	O
to	O
pass	O
by	O
to	O
rescue	O
her	O
!	O

--	O
It	O
certainly	O
was	O
very	O
extraordinary	O
!	O

--	O
And	O
knowing	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
did	O
,	O
the	O
favourable	O
state	O
of	O
mind	O
of	O
each	O
at	O
this	O
period	O
,	O
it	O
struck	O
her	O
the	O
more.	O

He	O
was	O
wishing	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
better	O
of	O
his	O
attachment	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
she	O
just	O
recovering	O
from	O
her	O
mania	O
for	O
Mr.	O
Elton.	O

It	O
seemed	O
as	O
if	O
every	O
thing	O
united	O
to	O
promise	O
the	O
most	O
interesting	O
consequences.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
possible	O
that	O
the	O
occurrence	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
strongly	O
recommending	O
each	O
to	O
the	O
other.	O

In	O
the	O
few	O
minutes	O
'	O
conversation	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
yet	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
while	O
Harriet	O
had	O
been	O
partially	O
insensible	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
spoken	O
of	O
her	O
terror	O
,	O
her	O
naivete	O
,	O
her	O
fervour	O
as	O
she	O
seized	O
and	O
clung	O
to	O
his	O
arm	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
sensibility	O
amused	O
and	O
delighted	O
;	O
and	O
just	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
after	O
Harriet	O
's	O
own	O
account	O
had	O
been	O
given	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
expressed	O
his	O
indignation	O
at	O
the	O
abominable	O
folly	O
of	O
Miss	O
Bickerton	O
in	O
the	O
warmest	O
terms.	O

Every	O
thing	O
was	O
to	O
take	O
its	O
natural	O
course	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
neither	O
impelled	O
nor	O
assisted.	O

She	O
would	O
not	O
stir	O
a	O
step	O
,	O
nor	O
drop	O
a	O
hint.	O

No	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
interference.	O

There	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
harm	O
in	O
a	O
scheme	O
,	O
a	O
mere	O
passive	O
scheme.	O

It	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
wish.	O

Beyond	O
it	O
she	O
would	O

without	O

from	O
Mr.	O

totally	O

of	O

when	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
she	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
tranquillised	O
and	O
subdued	O
--	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
sleepless	O
night	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
tax	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
evening	O

she	O
found	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
such	O
very	O
serious	O
points	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
as	O
made	O
her	O
feel	O
,	O
that	O
even	O
her	O
happiness	O
must	O
have	O
some	O
alloy.	O

Her	O
father	O
--	O
and	O
Harriet.	O

She	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
alone	O
without	O
feeling	O
the	O
full	O
weight	O
of	O
their	O
separate	O
claims	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
guard	O
the	O
comfort	O
of	O
both	O
to	O
the	O
utmost	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
question.	O

With	O
respect	O
to	O
her	O
father	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
question	O
soon	O
answered.	O

She	O
hardly	O
knew	O
yet	O
what	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
would	O
ask	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
parley	O
with	O
her	O
own	O
heart	O
produced	O
the	O
most	O
solemn	O
resolution	O
of	O
never	O
quitting	O
her	O
father.	O

--	O
She	O
even	O
wept	O
over	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
sin	O
of	O
thought.	O

While	O
he	O
lived	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
only	O
an	O
engagement	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
flattered	O
herself	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
divested	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
drawing	O
her	O
away	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
become	O
an	O
increase	O

How	O
to	O

--	O
On	O
these	O
subjects	O
,	O
her	O
perplexity	O
and	O
distress	O
were	O
very	O
great	O
--	O
and	O
her	O
mind	O
had	O
to	O
pass	O
again	O

again	O
through	O
every	O
bitter	O
reproach	O
and	O
sorrowful	O
regret	O
that	O
had	O
ever	O
surrounded	O
it.	O

--	O
She	O
could	O
only	O
resolve	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
still	O
avoid	O
a	O
meeting	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
communicate	O
all	O
that	O
need	O
be	O
told	O
by	O
letter	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
inexpressibly	O
desirable	O
to	O
have	O
her	O
removed	O
just	O
now	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
from	O
Highbury	O

it	O
might	O

practicable	O
to	O
get	O
an	O
invitation	O
for	O

to	O
Brunswick	O
Square.	O

--	O
Isabella	O
had	O
been	O
pleased	O
with	O
Harriet	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
spent	O
in	O
London	O
must	O
give	O
her	O
some	O
amusement.	O

did	O
not	O

At	O

would	O
be	O
a	O
proof	O
of	O
attention	O
and	O
kindness	O
in	O
herself	O

She	O
rose	O
early	O

and	O
wrote	O
her	O
letter	O
to	O
Harriet	O
;	O
an	O
employment	O

You	O

believe	O
there	O
will	O

need	O
of	O
even	O
all	O
your	O
goodness	O
to	O
allow	O
for	O
some	O
parts	O

my	O

I	O
have	O
been	O

one	O

still	O
more	O
to	O
resent.	O

My	O
courage	O
rises	O
while	O
I	O
write.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
for	O
the	O
prosperous	O
to	O

humble.	O

I	O
have	O
already	O
met	O
with	O
such	O
success	O
in	O
two	O
applications	O
for	O
pardon	O

that	O
I	O
may	O

my	O

which	O
was	O
to	O

at	O

My	O
right	O

only	O
important	O
part	O

order	O
to	O
assist	O
a	O

was	O
led	O
on	O
to	O
make	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
allowable	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
intimacy	O
into	O
which	O

thrown.	O

I	O

was	O
my	O

--	O
Amiable	O
and	O
delightful	O
as	O
Miss	O
Woodhouse	O
is	O
,	O
she	O
never	O
gave	O
me	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
a	O
young	O
woman	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
attached	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
perfectly	O
free	O
from	O
any	O
tendency	O
to	O
being	O
attached	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
my	O
conviction	O
as	O
my	O
wish.	O

--	O
She	O
received	O
my	O
attentions	O
with	O
an	O
easy	O
,	O
friendly	O
,	O
goodhumoured	O
playfulness	O
,	O
which	O
exactly	O
suited	O
me.	O

We	O
seemed	O
to	O
understand	O
each	O
other.	O

From	O
our	O
relative	O
situation	O
,	O
those	O
attentions	O
were	O
her	O
due	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
felt	O
to	O
be	O
so.	O

--	O
Whether	O
Miss	O
Woodhouse	O
began	O
really	O
to	O
understand	O
me	O
before	O
the	O
expiration	O
of	O
that	O
fortnight	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
say	O
;	O
--	O
when	O
I	O
called	O
to	O
take	O
leave	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
I	O
remember	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
within	O
a	O
moment	O
of	O
confessing	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
then	O
fancied	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
suspicion	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
her	O
having	O
since	O
detected	O
me	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
some	O
degree.	O

--	O
She	O
may	O
not	O
have	O
surmised	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
but	O
her	O
quickness	O
must	O
have	O
penetrated	O
a	O
part.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
doubt	O
it.	O

You	O
will	O
find	O
,	O
whenever	O
the	O
subject	O
becomes	O
freed	O
from	O
its	O
present	O
restraints	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
her	O
wholly	O
by	O
surprize.	O

She	O
frequently	O
gave	O
me	O
hints	O
of	O
it.	O

I	O
remember	O
her	O
telling	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
ball	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
owed	O
Mrs.	O

Elton	O
gratitude	O
for	O
her	O
attentions	O
to	O
Miss	O
Fairfax.	O

--	O
I	O
hope	O
this	O
history	O
of	O
my	O
conduct	O
towards	O
her	O
will	O
be	O
admitted	O
by	O
you	O
and	O
my	O
father	O
as	O
great	O
extenuation	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
saw	O
amiss.	O

While	O
you	O
considered	O
me	O
as	O
having	O
sinned	O
against	O
Emma	O
Woodhouse	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
deserve	O
nothing	O
from	O
either.	O

Acquit	O
me	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
procure	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
allowable	O
,	O
the	O
acquittal	O
and	O
good	O
wishes	O
of	O
that	O
said	O
Emma	O
Woodhouse	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
regard	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
brotherly	O
affection	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
long	O
to	O
have	O
her	O
as	O
deeply	O
and	O
as	O
happily	O
in	O
love	O
as	O
myself.	O

--	O
Whatever	O
strange	O
things	O
I	O
said	O
or	O
did	O
during	O
that	O
fortnight	O
,	O
you	O
have	O
now	O
a	O
key	O
to.	O

My	O
heart	O
was	O
in	O
Highbury	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
body	O
thither	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
least	O
suspicion.	O

If	O

account.	O

--	O
Of	O
the	O
pianoforte	O
so	O
much	O
talked	O
of	O

I	O
feel	O
it	O
only	O
necessary	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
its	O
being	O
ordered	O
was	O
absolutely	O
unknown	O
to	O
Miss	O
F	O
--	O

who	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
allowed	O
me	O
to	O
send	O
it	O

had	O
any	O
choice	O
been	O
given	O
her.	O

The	O

of	O
her	O
mind	O
throughout	O
the	O
whole	O
engagement	O

my	O
dear	O

,	O
is	O
much	O
beyond	O
my	O

justice	O
to.	O

You	O
will	O
soon	O
,	O
I	O
earnestly	O
hope	O
,	O
know	O
her	O
thoroughly	O
yourself.	O

--	O
No	O
description	O
can	O
describe	O
her.	O

She	O
must	O
tell	O
you	O
herself	O
what	O
she	O
is	O
--	O
yet	O
not	O
by	O
word	O
,	O
for	O
never	O
was	O
there	O
a	O
human	O
creature	O
who	O
would	O
so	O
designedly	O
suppress	O
her	O

merit.	O

--	O
Since	O
I	O
began	O
this	O
letter	O
,	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
longer	O
than	O
I	O
foresaw	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
from	O
her.	O

--	O
She	O
gives	O
a	O
good	O
account	O
of	O
her	O
own	O
health	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
she	O
never	O
complains	O
,	O
I	O
dare	O
not	O
depend.	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
your	O
opinion	O
of	O
her	O
looks.	O

I	O
know	O
you	O
will	O
soon	O
call	O
on	O
her	O
;	O
she	O
is	O
living	O
in	O
dread	O
of	O
the	O
visit.	O

Perhaps	O
it	O
is	O
paid	O
already.	O

Let	O
me	O
hear	O
from	O
you	O
without	O
delay	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
impatient	O
for	O
a	O
thousand	O
particulars.	O

Remember	O
how	O
few	O
minutes	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
Randalls	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
how	O
bewildered	O
,	O
how	O
mad	O
a	O
state	O
:	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
much	O
better	O
yet	O
;	O
still	O
insane	O
either	O
from	O
happiness	O
or	O
misery.	O

When	O
I	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
kindness	O

favour	O
I	O
have	O
met	O
with	O

of	O
her	O
excellence	O

my	O

how	O
little	O
I	O

If	O

her	O
again	O
!	O

--	O
But	O
I	O
must	O
not	O
propose	O
it	O
yet.	O

My	O
uncle	O
has	O
been	O
too	O
good	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
encroach.	O

--	O
I	O
must	O
still	O
add	O
to	O
this	O
long	O
letter.	O

You	O
have	O
not	O
heard	O
all	O
that	O
you	O
ought	O
to	O
hear.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
give	O
any	O

the	O
suddenness	O

in	O

unseasonableness	O

you	O
will	O
conclude	O
,	O
immediately	O
opened	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
happiest	O
prospects	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
presumed	O
on	O
such	O
early	O
measures	O

from	O
the	O
very	O
particular	O
circumstances	O

which	O
left	O
me	O
not	O
an	O

to	O
lose.	O

I	O
should	O
myself	O
have	O
shrunk	O
from	O
any	O
thing	O
so	O
hasty	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
felt	O
every	O
scruple	O
of	O
mine	O
with	O
multiplied	O
strength	O
and	O
refinement.	O

--	O
But	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
choice.	O

The	O
hasty	O
engagement	O

had	O
entered	O
into	O
with	O
that	O
woman	O
--	O
Here	O
,	O
my	O
dear	O
madam	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
off	O
abruptly	O
,	O
to	O
recollect	O
and	O
compose	O
myself.	O

--	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
walking	O
over	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
am	O
now	O
,	O
I	O
hope	O
,	O
rational	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O
letter	O
what	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be.	O

--	O
It	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
a	O
most	O
mortifying	O
retrospect	O
for	O
me.	O

I	O
behaved	O
shamefully.	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
can	O
admit	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
manners	O
to	O
Miss	O
W.	O

,	O
in	O
being	O
unpleasant	O
to	O
Miss	O
F.	O

,	O
were	O
highly	O
blameable.	O

_She_	O
disapproved	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
enough.	O

--	O
My	O
plea	O
of	O
concealing	O
the	O
truth	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
sufficient.	O

--	O
She	O
was	O
displeased	O
;	O
I	O
thought	O
unreasonably	O
so	O
:	O
I	O
thought	O
her	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
thousand	O
occasions	O
,	O
unnecessarily	O
scrupulous	O
and	O
cautious	O
:	O
I	O
thought	O
her	O
even	O
cold.	O

But	O
she	O
was	O
always	O
right.	O

If	O
I	O
had	O
followed	O
her	O
judgment	O
,	O
and	O
subdued	O
my	O
spirits	O
to	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
what	O
she	O
deemed	O
proper	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
escaped	O
the	O
greatest	O
unhappiness	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
known.	O

--	O
We	O
quarrelled.	O

--	O
Do	O
you	O
remember	O
the	O
morning	O
spent	O
at	O
Donwell	O
?	O

--	O
_There_	O
every	O
little	O
dissatisfaction	O
that	O
had	O
occurred	O
before	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
crisis.	O

I	O
was	O
late	O
;	O
I	O
met	O
her	O
walking	O
home	O
by	O
herself	O
,	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
walk	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
it.	O

She	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
to	O
allow	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
then	O
thought	O
most	O
unreasonable.	O

Now	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
see	O
nothing	O
in	O
it	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
natural	O
and	O
consistent	O
degree	O
of	O
discretion.	O

While	O
I	O
,	O
to	O
blind	O
the	O
world	O

our	O
engagement	O

was	O
behaving	O
one	O
hour	O
with	O
objectionable	O

another	O

she	O
to	O
be	O
consenting	O
the	O
next	O
to	O
a	O
proposal	O

might	O
have	O
made	O
every	O

we	O
been	O
met	O
walking	O
together	O
between	O
Donwell	O

Highbury	O

the	O
truth	O
must	O

suspected.	O

--	O
I	O
was	O
mad	O
enough	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
resent.	O

--	O
I	O
doubted	O
her	O
affection.	O

I	O
doubted	O
it	O
more	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
on	O
Box	O
Hill	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
provoked	O
by	O
such	O
conduct	O
on	O
my	O
side	O

such	O
shameful	O

insolent	O
neglect	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
apparent	O
devotion	O
to	O
Miss	O
W.	O

as	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
impossible	O
for	O
any	O
woman	O
of	O
sense	O
to	O
endure	O
,	O
she	O
spoke	O
her	O
resentment	O
in	O
a	O
form	O
of	O
words	O
perfectly	O
intelligible	O
to	O
me.	O

--	O
In	O
short	O
,	O
my	O
dear	O
madam	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
quarrel	O
blameless	O
on	O
her	O
side	O
,	O
abominable	O
on	O
mine	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
returned	O
the	O
same	O
evening	O
to	O
Richmond	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
staid	O
with	O
you	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
merely	O
because	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
angry	O
with	O
her	O
as	O
possible.	O

Even	O
then	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
fool	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
mean	O
to	O
be	O
reconciled	O
in	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
injured	O
person	O
,	O
injured	O
by	O
her	O
coldness	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
away	O
determined	O
that	O
she	O
should	O
make	O
the	O
first	O
advances.	O

--	O
I	O
shall	O
always	O
congratulate	O
myself	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
Box	O
Hill	O
party.	O

Had	O
you	O
witnessed	O
my	O
behaviour	O
there	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
hardly	O
suppose	O
you	O
would	O
ever	O
have	O
thought	O
well	O
of	O
me	O
again.	O

Its	O
effect	O
upon	O
her	O
appears	O
in	O
the	O
immediate	O
resolution	O
it	O
produced	O
:	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
found	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
gone	O

of	O
whose	O
treatment	O
of	O
her	O

by	O
the	O
bye	O
,	O
has	O
ever	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
indignation	O
and	O
hatred.	O

I	O
must	O
not	O
quarrel	O
with	O
a	O
spirit	O
of	O
forbearance	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
richly	O
extended	O
towards	O
myself	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
otherwise	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
loudly	O
protest	O
against	O
the	O

of	O
it	O
which	O
that	O
woman	O
has	O
known.	O

You	O

myself	O
in	O

what	O

any	O

from	O
her	O

In	O
such	O
a	O
party	O
,	O
Harriet	O
would	O
be	O
rather	O
a	O
dead	O
weight	O
than	O
otherwise	O
;	O
but	O
for	O
the	O

CHAPTER	O
XVI	O
It	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
relief	O
to	O
Emma	O
to	O
find	O
Harriet	O
as	O
desirous	O
as	O
herself	O
to	O
avoid	O
a	O
meeting.	O

Their	O
intercourse	O
was	O
painful	O
enough	O
by	O
letter.	O

How	O
much	O
worse	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
meet	O
!	O

Harriet	O
expressed	O
herself	O
very	O
much	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
supposed	O
,	O
without	O
reproaches	O
,	O
or	O
apparent	O
sense	O
of	O
ill-usage	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
Emma	O
fancied	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
something	O
of	O
resentment	O
,	O
a	O
something	O
bordering	O
on	O
it	O
in	O
her	O
style	O
,	O
which	O
increased	O
the	O
desirableness	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
separate.	O

--	O
It	O
might	O
be	O
only	O
her	O
own	O
consciousness	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
seemed	O
as	O
if	O
an	O
angel	O
only	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
quite	O
without	O
resentment	O
under	O
such	O
a	O
stroke.	O

She	O
had	O
no	O
difficulty	O
in	O
procuring	O
Isabella	O
's	O
invitation	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
was	O
fortunate	O
in	O
having	O
a	O
sufficient	O
reason	O
for	O
asking	O
it	O
,	O
without	O
resorting	O
to	O
invention.	O

--	O
There	O
was	O
a	O
tooth	O
amiss.	O

Harriet	O
really	O
wished	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
wished	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
consult	O
a	O
dentist.	O

Mrs.	O

John	O
Knightley	O
was	O
delighted	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
use	O
;	O
any	O
thing	O
of	O
ill	O
health	O
was	O
a	O
recommendation	O
to	O
her	O
--	O
and	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
fond	O
of	O
a	O
dentist	O
as	O
of	O
a	O
Mr.	O
Wingfield	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
quite	O
eager	O
to	O
have	O
Harriet	O
under	O
her	O
care.	O

--	O
When	O
it	O
was	O
thus	O
settled	O
on	O
her	O
sister	O
's	O
side	O
,	O
Emma	O
proposed	O
it	O
to	O
her	O
friend	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
her	O
very	O
persuadable.	O

--	O
Harriet	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
invited	O
for	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
fortnight	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
conveyed	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
carriage.	O

--	O
It	O
was	O
all	O
arranged	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
completed	O
,	O
and	O
Harriet	O
was	O
safe	O
in	O
Brunswick	O
Square.	O

Now	O
Emma	O
could	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
enjoy	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O
's	O
visits	O
;	O
now	O
she	O
could	O
talk	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
could	O
listen	O
with	O
true	O
happiness	O
,	O
unchecked	O
by	O
that	O
sense	O
of	O
injustice	O
,	O
of	O
guilt	O
,	O
of	O
something	O
most	O
painful	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
haunted	O
her	O
when	O
remembering	O
how	O
disappointed	O
a	O
heart	O
was	O
near	O
her	O
,	O
how	O
much	O
might	O
at	O
that	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
be	O
enduring	O
by	O
the	O
feelings	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
led	O
astray	O
herself.	O

The	O
difference	O
of	O
Harriet	O
at	O
Mrs.	O

Goddard	O
's	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
London	O
,	O
made	O
perhaps	O
an	O
unreasonable	O
difference	O
in	O
Emma	O
's	O
sensations	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
of	O
her	O
in	O
London	O
without	O
objects	O
of	O
curiosity	O
and	O
employment	O
,	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
averting	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
and	O
carrying	O
her	O
out	O
of	O
herself.	O

She	O
would	O
not	O
allow	O
any	O
other	O
anxiety	O
to	O
succeed	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
in	O
her	O
mind	O
which	O
Harriet	O
had	O
occupied.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
communication	O
before	O
her	O
,	O
one	O
which	O
_she_	O
only	O
could	O
be	O
competent	O
to	O
make	O
--	O
the	O
confession	O
of	O
her	O
engagement	O
to	O
her	O
father	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
it	O
at	O
present.	O

--	O
She	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
defer	O
the	O
disclosure	O
till	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
were	O
safe	O
and	O
well.	O

No	O
additional	O
agitation	O
should	O
be	O
thrown	O
at	O
this	O
period	O
among	O
those	O
she	O
loved	O
--	O
and	O
the	O
evil	O
should	O
not	O
act	O
on	O
herself	O
by	O
anticipation	O
before	O
the	O
appointed	O
time.	O

--	O
A	O
fortnight	O

of	O
leisure	O
and	O

every	O
warmer	O
,	O
but	O
more	O
agitating	O
,	O
delight	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
hers.	O

She	O
soon	O
resolved	O
,	O
equally	O
as	O
a	O
duty	O
and	O
a	O
pleasure	O
,	O
to	O
employ	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
of	O
this	O
holiday	O
of	O
spirits	O
in	O
calling	O
on	O
Miss	O

She	O
ought	O

every	O
other	O
motive	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
_secret_	O
satisfaction	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
consciousness	O
of	O
a	O
similarity	O
of	O

would	O
certainly	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
interest	O
with	O
which	O
she	O
should	O

to	O
any	O

Jane	O
might	O

her	O
fresh	O
reason	O
for	O

so.	O

--	O
Harriet	O

Pilfering	O

_housebreaking_	O
to	O
Mr.	O

's	O
fears.	O

He	O
was	O
very	O
uneasy	O
;	O
and	O

for	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
his	O
son-in-law	O

protection	O

that	O

with	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
