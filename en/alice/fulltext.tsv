whether	O
the	O
pleasure	O

be	O

when	O
suddenly	O
a	O
White	O
Rabbit	O
with	O

ran	O
close	O
by	O
her.	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O

that	O

when	O
the	O

actually	O
_took	O
a	O
watch	O
out	O
of	O

,	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
hurried	O
on	O
,	O
Alice	O
started	O
to	O
her	O
feet	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
flashed	O
across	O
her	O
mind	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
never	O
before	O
seen	O
a	O
rabbit	O
with	O
either	O
a	O
waistcoat-pocket	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
watch	O
to	O
take	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
burning	O
with	O
curiosity	O
,	O
she	O
ran	O
across	O
the	O
field	O
after	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
fortunately	O
was	O
just	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
pop	O
down	O
a	O
large	O
rabbit-hole	O
under	O
the	O
hedge.	O

In	O
another	O
moment	O
down	O
went	O
Alice	O
after	O
it	O
,	O
never	O
once	O
considering	O
how	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
she	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
again.	O

The	O
rabbit-hole	O
went	O
straight	O
on	O
like	O
a	O
tunnel	O
for	O
some	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
dipped	O
suddenly	O
down	O
,	O
so	O
suddenly	O
that	O
Alice	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
moment	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
stopping	O
herself	O
before	O
she	O
found	O
herself	O
falling	O
down	O
a	O
very	O
deep	O
well.	O

Either	O
the	O
well	O
was	O
very	O
deep	O
,	O
or	O
she	O
fell	O
very	O
slowly	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
time	O
as	O
she	O
went	O
down	O
to	O
look	O
about	O
her	O
and	O
to	O
wonder	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
next.	O

First	O
,	O
she	O
tried	O
to	O
look	O
down	O
and	O
make	O
out	O
what	O
she	O
was	O
coming	O
to	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
dark	O
to	O
see	O
anything	O
;	O
then	O
she	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
noticed	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
filled	O
with	O
cupboards	O
and	O
book-shelves	O
;	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
she	O
saw	O
maps	O
and	O
pictures	O
hung	O
upon	O
pegs.	O

She	O
took	O
down	O
a	O
jar	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
shelves	O
as	O
she	O
passed	O
;	O
it	O
was	O

but	O
to	O
her	O
great	O
disappointment	O
it	O
was	O
empty	O
:	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
like	O
to	O
drop	O
the	O
jar	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
killing	O
somebody	O
underneath	O

at	O

in	O

her	O

succeeded	O
in	O
getting	O
its	O
body	O
tucked	O
away	O
,	O
comfortably	O
enough	O
,	O
under	O
her	O
arm	O
,	O
with	O
its	O
legs	O
hanging	O
down	O
,	O
but	O
generally	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
its	O
neck	O
nicely	O
straightened	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
hedgehog	O
a	O
blow	O
with	O
its	O
head	O
,	O
it	O
_would_	O
twist	O
itself	O
round	O
and	O
look	O
up	O
in	O
her	O
face	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
puzzled	O
expression	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
bursting	O
out	O
laughing	O

when	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
its	O
head	O
down	O

was	O
going	O
to	O
begin	O
again	O

very	O

to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
hedgehog	O
had	O
unrolled	O
itself	O

was	O
in	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
crawling	O
away	O

besides	O
all	O
this	O

there	O
was	O
generally	O
a	O
ridge	O
or	O
furrow	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
wherever	O
she	O
wanted	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
hedgehog	O
to	O

,	O
as	O

Alice	O

it	O

a	O
very	O
difficult	O
game	O
indeed.	O
