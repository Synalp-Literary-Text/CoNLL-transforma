The	O
real	O

of	O

the	O

took	O
place	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
infinite	O
mortification	O
of	O
Mr.	O
and	O
Mrs.	O
Churchill	O
,	O
who	O
threw	O
her	O
off	O
with	O
due	O
decorum.	O

It	O
was	O
an	O
unsuitable	O
connexion	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
produce	O
much	O
happiness.	O

Mrs.	O
Weston	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
found	O
more	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
husband	O
whose	O
warm	O
heart	O
and	O
sweet	O
temper	O
made	O
him	O
think	O
every	O
thing	O
due	O
to	O
her	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
the	O
great	O
goodness	O
of	O
being	O
in	O

with	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
she	O
had	O
one	O
sort	O
of	O

she	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
best.	O

She	O
had	O
resolution	O
enough	O
to	O
pursue	O
her	O
own	O
will	O
in	O

of	O
her	O

not	O

to	O

from	O

at	O
that	O

unreasonable	O
anger	O
,	O
nor	O
from	O
missing	O
the	O
luxuries	O
of	O
her	O
former	O
home.	O

They	O
lived	O
beyond	O
their	O
income	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
in	O
comparison	O
of	O
Enscombe	O
:	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
cease	O
to	O
love	O
her	O

she	O

Captain	O
Weston	O

by	O
the	O

as	O

the	O
worst	O
of	O

for	O
when	O
his	O

after	O
a	O
three	O
years	O

he	O
was	O

man	O
than	O
at	O

and	O
with	O
a	O
child	O
to	O

From	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

he	O
was	O

of	O

Some	O
scruples	O
and	O
some	O
reluctance	O
the	O
widower-father	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
felt	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
overcome	O
by	O
other	O
considerations	O
,	O
the	O
child	O
was	O
given	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
and	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
the	O
Churchills	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
only	O
his	O
own	O
comfort	O
to	O
seek	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
own	O
situation	O
to	O
improve	O
as	O
he	O
could.	O

A	O
complete	O
change	O
of	O
life	O
became	O
desirable.	O

He	O
quitted	O
the	O
militia	O
and	O
engaged	O
in	O
trade	O
,	O
having	O
brothers	O
already	O
established	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
in	O
London	O
,	O
which	O
afforded	O
him	O
a	O
favourable	O
opening.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
concern	O
which	O
brought	O
just	O
employment	O
enough.	O

He	O
had	O
still	O
a	O
small	O
house	O
in	O
Highbury	O
,	O
where	O
most	O
of	O
his	O
leisure	O
days	O
were	O
spent	O
;	O
and	O
between	O
useful	O
occupation	O
and	O
the	O
pleasures	O
of	O
society	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
eighteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
years	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
passed	O
cheerfully	O
away.	O

He	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
realised	O
an	O
easy	O
competence	O
--	O
enough	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
purchase	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
estate	O
adjoining	O
Highbury	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
always	O
longed	O
for	O
--	O
enough	O
to	O
marry	O
a	O
woman	O
as	O
portionless	O
even	O
as	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
live	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
wishes	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
friendly	O
and	O
social	O
disposition.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
some	O
time	O
since	O
Miss	O
Taylor	O
had	O
begun	O
to	O
influence	O
his	O
schemes	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
tyrannic	O
influence	O
of	O
youth	O
on	O
youth	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
shaken	O
his	O
determination	O
of	O
never	O
settling	O
till	O
he	O
could	O
purchase	O
Randalls	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sale	O
of	O
Randalls	O
was	O
long	O
looked	O
forward	O
to	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
steadily	O
on	O
,	O
with	O
these	O
objects	O
in	O
view	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
accomplished.	O

He	O
had	O
made	O
his	O
fortune	O
,	O
bought	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
obtained	O
his	O
wife	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
beginning	O
a	O
new	O
period	O
of	O
existence	O
,	O
with	O
every	O
probability	O
of	O
greater	O
happiness	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
yet	O
passed	O
through.	O

He	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
an	O
unhappy	O
man	O
;	O
his	O
own	O
temper	O
had	O
secured	O
him	O
from	O
that	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
his	O
first	O
marriage	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
second	O
must	O
shew	O
him	O
how	O
delightful	O
a	O
well-judging	O
and	O
truly	O
amiable	O
woman	O
could	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
pleasantest	O
proof	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
better	O
to	O
choose	O
than	O
to	O
be	O
chosen	O
,	O
to	O
excite	O
gratitude	O
than	O
to	O
feel	O
it.	O

He	O
had	O
only	O
himself	O
to	O
please	O
in	O
his	O
choice	O
:	O
his	O
fortune	O
was	O
his	O
own	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
Frank	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
being	O
tacitly	O
brought	O
up	O
as	O
his	O
uncle	O
's	O
heir	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
become	O
so	O
avowed	O
an	O
adoption	O
as	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
assume	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Churchill	O
on	O
coming	O
of	O
age.	O

It	O
was	O
most	O
unlikely	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
ever	O
want	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
assistance.	O

His	O
father	O
had	O
no	O
apprehension	O
of	O
it.	O

The	O
aunt	O
was	O
a	O
capricious	O
woman	O
,	O
and	O
governed	O
her	O
husband	O
entirely	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Weston	O
's	O
nature	O
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
any	O
caprice	O
could	O
be	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
affect	O
one	O
so	O
dear	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
believed	O
,	O
so	O
deservedly	O
dear.	O

He	O
saw	O
his	O
son	O
every	O
year	O
in	O
London	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
proud	O
of	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
fond	O
report	O
of	O
him	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
young	O
man	O
had	O
made	O
Highbury	O
feel	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
pride	O
in	O
him	O
too.	O

He	O
was	O
looked	O
on	O
as	O
sufficiently	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
merits	O
and	O
prospects	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
common	O
concern.	O

Mr.	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boasts	O
of	O
Highbury	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
lively	O
curiosity	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
prevailed	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
compliment	O
was	O
so	O
little	O
returned	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
there	O
in	O
his	O
life.	O

His	O
coming	O
to	O
visit	O
his	O
father	O
had	O
been	O
often	O
talked	O
of	O
but	O
never	O
achieved.	O

Now	O
,	O
upon	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
marriage	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
generally	O
proposed	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
most	O
proper	O
attention	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
visit	O
should	O
take	O
place.	O

There	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
dissentient	O
voice	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
,	O
either	O
when	O
Mrs.	O
Perry	O
drank	O
tea	O
with	O
Mrs.	O
and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
,	O
or	O
when	O
Mrs.	O
and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
returned	O
the	O
visit.	O

Now	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
for	O
Mr.	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
to	O
come	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
hope	O
strengthened	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
understood	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
written	O
to	O
his	O
new	O
mother	O
on	O
the	O
occasion.	O

For	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
every	O
morning	O
visit	O
in	O
Highbury	O
included	O
some	O
mention	O
of	O
the	O
handsome	O
letter	O
Mrs.	O
Weston	O
had	O
received.	O

"	O
I	O
suppose	O
you	O
have	O
heard	O
of	O
the	O
handsome	O
letter	O
Mr.	O
Frank	O
Churchill	O
has	O
written	O
to	O
Mrs.	O
Weston	O

I	O
understand	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
letter	O

indeed.	O

Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
told	O
me	O
of	O
it.	O

Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
saw	O
the	O
letter	O

Mrs.	O

had	O

formed	O
a	O
very	O
favourable	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
young	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
such	O
a	O
pleasing	O
attention	O
was	O
an	O
irresistible	O
proof	O
of	O
his	O
great	O
good	O
sense	O

and	O
a	O
most	O
welcome	O
addition	O
to	O
every	O
source	O
and	O
every	O
expression	O
of	O
congratulation	O
which	O
her	O
marriage	O
had	O
already	O
secured.	O

She	O
felt	O
herself	O
a	O
most	O
fortunate	O
woman	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
lived	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
fortunate	O
she	O
might	O
well	O
be	O
thought	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
only	O
regret	O
was	O
for	O
a	O
partial	O
separation	O
from	O

whose	O
friendship	O
for	O
her	O
had	O
never	O
cooled	O

and	O
who	O
could	O
ill	O
bear	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
her.	O

She	O
knew	O
that	O
at	O
times	O
she	O
must	O
be	O
missed	O

could	O

Emma	O
was	O
of	O
no	O

she	O
was	O
more	O

in	O
the	O
very	O
easy	O
distance	O

Mr.	O
Perry	O
was	O
an	O
intelligent	O
,	O
gentlemanlike	O
man	O
,	O
whose	O
frequent	O
visits	O
were	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
comforts	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
being	O
applied	O
to	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
acknowledge	O
(	O
though	O
it	O
seemed	O
rather	O
against	O
the	O
bias	O
of	O
inclination	O
)	O
that	O
wedding-cake	O
might	O
certainly	O
disagree	O
with	O
many	O
--	O
perhaps	O
with	O
most	O
people	O
,	O
unless	O
taken	O
moderately.	O

With	O
such	O
an	O
opinion	O
,	O
in	O
confirmation	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
hoped	O
to	O
influence	O
every	O
visitor	O
of	O
the	O
newly	O
married	O
pair	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
the	O
cake	O
was	O
eaten	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
rest	O
for	O
his	O
benevolent	O
nerves	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
gone.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
strange	O
rumour	O
in	O
Highbury	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
little	O
Perrys	O
being	O
seen	O
with	O
a	O
slice	O
of	O
Mrs.	O
Weston	O
's	O
wedding-cake	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
:	O
but	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
would	O
never	O
believe	O
it.	O

Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
was	O
fond	O
of	O
society	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
way.	O

He	O
liked	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
have	O
his	O
friends	O
come	O
and	O
see	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
various	O
united	O
causes	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
long	O
residence	O
at	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
good	O
nature	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
fortune	O
,	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
daughter	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
command	O
the	O
visits	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
little	O
circle	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
liked.	O

He	O
had	O
not	O
much	O
intercourse	O
with	O
any	O
families	O
beyond	O
that	O
circle	O
;	O
his	O
horror	O
of	O
late	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
dinner-parties	O
,	O
made	O
him	O
unfit	O
for	O
any	O
acquaintance	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
would	O
visit	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
terms.	O

Fortunately	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
Highbury	O

in	O
the	O
parish	O

the	O

of	O
Mr.	O
Knightley	O

comprehended	O
many	O
such.	O

Not	O
unfrequently	O
,	O
through	O
Emma	O
's	O
persuasion	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
chosen	O
and	O
the	O
best	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
him	O
:	O
but	O
evening	O
parties	O
were	O
what	O
he	O
preferred	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
unless	O
he	O
fancied	O
himself	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
unequal	O
to	O
company	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
scarcely	O
an	O
evening	O
in	O
the	O
week	O
in	O
which	O
Emma	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
up	O
a	O

the	O

Mr.	O
Knightley	O

Mr.	O
Elton	O

the	O
privilege	O
of	O
exchanging	O
any	O
vacant	O
evening	O
of	O
his	O

blank	O
solitude	O
for	O
the	O
elegancies	O
and	O
society	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
's	O
drawing-room	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
smiles	O
of	O
his	O
lovely	O
daughter	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
no	O
danger	O
of	O

thrown	O
away.	O

After	O
these	O
came	O
a	O
second	O
set	O
;	O
among	O
the	O
most	O
come-at-able	O
of	O
whom	O
were	O
Mrs.	O

and	O
Miss	O
Bates	O
,	O
and	O
Mrs.	O
Goddard	O
,	O
three	O
ladies	O
almost	O
always	O
at	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
an	O
invitation	O
from	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
were	O
fetched	O
and	O
carried	O
home	O
so	O
often	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
thought	O
it	O
no	O
hardship	O
for	O
either	O
James	O
or	O
the	O
horses.	O
Had	O
it	O
taken	O
place	O
only	O
once	O
a	O
year	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
grievance.	O

Mrs.	O
Bates	O
,	O
the	O
widow	O
of	O
a	O
former	O
vicar	O
of	O
Highbury	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
old	O
lady	O
,	O
almost	O
past	O
every	O
thing	O
but	O
tea	O
and	O
quadrille.	O

She	O
lived	O
with	O
her	O
single	O
daughter	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
considered	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
regard	O
and	O
respect	O
which	O
a	O
harmless	O
old	O
lady	O
,	O
under	O
such	O
untoward	O
circumstances	O
,	O
can	O
excite.	O

Her	O
daughter	O
enjoyed	O
a	O
most	O
uncommon	O
degree	O
of	O
popularity	O
for	O
a	O
woman	O
neither	O
young	O
,	O
handsome	O
,	O
rich	O
,	O
nor	O
married.	O

Miss	O
Bates	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
worst	O
predicament	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
for	O
having	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
favour	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
had	O
no	O
intellectual	O
superiority	O
to	O
make	O
atonement	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
or	O
frighten	O
those	O
who	O
might	O
hate	O
her	O
into	O
outward	O
respect.	O

She	O
had	O
never	O
boasted	O
either	O
beauty	O
or	O
cleverness.	O
Her	O
youth	O
had	O
passed	O
without	O
distinction	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
middle	O
of	O
life	O
was	O
devoted	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
a	O
failing	O
mother	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
endeavour	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
small	O
income	O
go	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
possible.	O

And	O
yet	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
happy	O
woman	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
woman	O
whom	O
no	O
one	O
named	O
without	O
good-will.	O

It	O
was	O
her	O
own	O
universal	O
good-will	O
and	O
contented	O
temper	O
which	O
worked	O
such	O
wonders.	O

She	O
loved	O
every	O
body	O
,	O
was	O
interested	O
in	O
every	O
body	O
's	O
happiness	O
,	O
quicksighted	O
to	O
every	O
body	O
's	O
merits	O
;	O
thought	O
herself	O
a	O
most	O
fortunate	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
surrounded	O
with	O
blessings	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
excellent	O
mother	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
many	O
good	O
neighbours	O
and	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
home	O
that	O
wanted	O
for	O
nothing.	O

The	O
simplicity	O
and	O
cheerfulness	O
of	O
her	O
nature	O
,	O
her	O
contented	O
and	O
grateful	O
spirit	O
,	O
were	O
a	O
recommendation	O
to	O
every	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
mine	O
of	O
felicity	O
to	O
herself.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
talker	O
upon	O
little	O
matters	O
,	O
which	O
exactly	O
suited	O
Mr.	O
Woodhouse	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
trivial	O
communications	O
and	O
harmless	O
gossip.	O

Mrs.	O

Mrs.	O

Goddard	O

was	O
in	O
high	O
repute	O

and	O
very	O
deservedly	O
;	O
for	O
Highbury	O
was	O
reckoned	O

she	O
had	O
an	O

summer	O

and	O
in	O
winter	O
dressed	O
their	O
chilblains	O
with	O

It	O
was	O
no	O
wonder	O
that	O
a	O
train	O
of	O
twenty	O
young	O
couple	O
now	O
walked	O
after	O
her	O
to	O
church.	O

She	O
was	O

who	O
had	O
worked	O

and	O
having	O

Mr.	O

These	O

the	O

it	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
for	O
the	O

Mrs.	O

She	O
was	O

to	O

and	O
very	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
herself	O
for	O

things	O
so	O
well	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
quiet	O
prosings	O
of	O
three	O
such	O
women	O
made	O
her	O
feel	O
that	O
every	O
evening	O
so	O
spent	O
was	O
indeed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
long	O
evenings	O
she	O
had	O
fearfully	O
anticipated.	O

As	O
she	O
sat	O
one	O

such	O
a	O
close	O

for	O
Miss	O
Smith	O

a	O
girl	O
of	O
seventeen	O

whom	O
Emma	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
by	O

had	O
long	O
felt	O
an	O
interest	O
in	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
her	O
beauty.	O

A	O
very	O
gracious	O
invitation	O
was	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
evening	O
no	O
longer	O
dreaded	O
by	O
the	O
fair	O
mistress	O
of	O
the	O
mansion.	O

Harriet	O
Smith	O
was	O
the	O
natural	O
daughter	O
of	O
somebody.	O

Somebody	O
had	O
placed	O
her	O
,	O
several	O
years	O
back	O
,	O
at	O
Mrs.	O
Goddard	O
's	O
school	O
,	O
and	O
somebody	O
had	O
lately	O
raised	O
her	O
from	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
scholar	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
parlour-boarder.	O

This	O
was	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
generally	O
known	O
of	O
her	O
history.	O

She	O
had	O
no	O
visible	O
friends	O
but	O
what	O
had	O
been	O
acquired	O
at	O
Highbury	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
now	O
just	O
returned	O
from	O
a	O
long	O
visit	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
some	O
young	O
ladies	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
school	O
there	O
with	O
her.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
girl	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
beauty	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
a	O
sort	O
which	O
Emma	O
particularly	O
admired.	O

She	O
was	O
short	O
,	O
plump	O
,	O
and	O
fair	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
bloom	O
,	O
blue	O
eyes	O

light	O
hair	O

regular	O

a	O
look	O

great	O
sweetness	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
Emma	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
her	O
manners	O
as	O
her	O
person	O
,	O
and	O
quite	O
determined	O
to	O
continue	O
the	O
acquaintance.	O

She	O
was	O
not	O
struck	O
by	O
any	O
thing	O
remarkably	O
clever	O
in	O
Miss	O
Smith	O
's	O
conversation	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
found	O
her	O
altogether	O
very	O
engaging	O
--	O
not	O
inconveniently	O
shy	O
,	O
not	O
unwilling	O
to	O
talk	O
--	O
and	O
yet	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
pushing	O
,	O
shewing	O
so	O
proper	O
and	O
becoming	O
a	O
deference	O
,	O
seeming	O
so	O
pleasantly	O
grateful	O
for	O
being	O
admitted	O
to	O
Hartfield	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
artlessly	O
impressed	O
by	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
every	O
thing	O
in	O
so	O
superior	O
a	O
style	O
to	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
must	O
have	O
good	O
sense	O
,	O
and	O
deserve	O
encouragement.	O
Encouragement	O
should	O
be	O
given.	O

Those	O
soft	O
blue	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
those	O
natural	O
graces	O
,	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
wasted	O
on	O
the	O
inferior	O
society	O
of	O
Highbury	O
and	O
its	O
connexions.	O

The	O
acquaintance	O
she	O
had	O
already	O
formed	O
were	O
unworthy	O
of	O
her.	O

The	O
friends	O
from	O

she	O
had	O
just	O
parted	O

though	O
very	O
good	O
sort	O
of	O
