itself	I-QUOTE

could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
get	I-QUOTE
rid	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
brought	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
royalties	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
stars	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
garters	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
elderly	I-QUOTE
ladies	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
gigantic	I-QUOTE
tiaras	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
parrot	I-QUOTE
noses.	I-QUOTE
She	I-QUOTE
spoke	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
dearest	I-QUOTE
friend.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
took	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
head	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
lionize	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
believe	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
picture	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
mine	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
success	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
chattered	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
penny	I-QUOTE
newspapers	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
nineteenth-century	I-QUOTE
standard	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
immortality.	I-QUOTE

Suddenly	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
myself	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
man	I-QUOTE
whose	I-QUOTE
personality	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
strangely	I-QUOTE
stirred	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE
We	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
close	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
touching.	I-QUOTE
Our	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
reckless	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
asked	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
introduce	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

Perhaps	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
reckless	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
all.	I-QUOTE
It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
inevitable.	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
spoken	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
without	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
introduction.	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
sure	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
that.	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
afterwards.	I-QUOTE
He	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
destined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
And	B-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
describe	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
wonderful	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
man	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE
"	O
asked	O
his	O
companion.	O

"	O
I	B-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
goes	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
giving	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
rapid	I-QUOTE
_pr	I-QUOTE
cis_	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
guests.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
remember	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
bringing	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
truculent	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
red-faced	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
gentleman	I-QUOTE
covered	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
orders	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
ribbons	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
hissing	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
ear	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
tragic	I-QUOTE
whisper	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
perfectly	I-QUOTE
audible	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
everybody	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
room	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
astounding	I-QUOTE
details.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
fled.	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
myself.	I-QUOTE
But	I-QUOTE
Lady	I-QUOTE
Brandon	I-QUOTE
treats	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
guests	I-QUOTE
exactly	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
auctioneer	I-QUOTE
treats	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
goods.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
either	I-QUOTE
explains	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
tells	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
except	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
wants	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know.	I-QUOTE

If	I-QUOTE

Of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

tell	I-QUOTE

such	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

since	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE

in	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE

will	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
understand	I-QUOTE

his	I-QUOTE

suggested	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE

an	I-QUOTE

manner	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE

an	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
now	I-QUOTE
recreate	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE

We	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
madness	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
separated	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE

am	I-QUOTE
analysing	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
present	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
ought	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
subject	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
abstruse	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
was.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
ultimately	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
kinds	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
plain	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
coloured.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
plain	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
useful.	I-QUOTE
If	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
want	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
gain	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
reputation	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
respectability	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
supper.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
charming.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
commit	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
mistake	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
however.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
paint	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
order	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
try	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
young.	I-QUOTE

Our	I-QUOTE
grandmothers	I-QUOTE
painted	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
order	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
try	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
talk	I-QUOTE
brilliantly.	I-QUOTE

_Rouge_	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
_esprit_	I-QUOTE
used	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
together.	I-QUOTE

That	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
now.	I-QUOTE

As	I-QUOTE
long	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
woman	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
ten	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
younger	I-QUOTE
than	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
daughter	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
perfectly	I-QUOTE
satisfied.	I-QUOTE

As	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
conversation	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
five	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
London	I-QUOTE
worth	I-QUOTE
talking	I-QUOTE

decent	I-QUOTE
society.	I-QUOTE

However	I-QUOTE

tell	I-QUOTE

about	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE

will	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE

but	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
mustn	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
unsympathetic	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE
After	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
happened	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
filled	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
wild	I-QUOTE
desire	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

For	I-QUOTE
days	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
met	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
throb	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
veins.	I-QUOTE

As	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
lounged	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
park	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
strolled	I-QUOTE
down	I-QUOTE
Piccadilly	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
used	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
passed	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
mad	I-QUOTE
curiosity	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
lives	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
led.	I-QUOTE

Some	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
fascinated	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

Others	I-QUOTE
filled	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
terror.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
poison	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
air.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
sensations	I-QUOTE
...	I-QUOTE
.	I-QUOTE
Well	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
seven	I-QUOTE
o	I-QUOTE
clock	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
search	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
adventure.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
grey	I-QUOTE
monstrous	I-QUOTE
London	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
ours	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
myriads	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
sordid	I-QUOTE
sinners	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
its	I-QUOTE
splendid	I-QUOTE
sins	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
phrased	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
store	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
fancied	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
thousand	I-QUOTE
things.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
mere	I-QUOTE
danger	I-QUOTE
gave	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sense	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
delight.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
remembered	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
wonderful	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
dined	I-QUOTE
together	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
search	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
real	I-QUOTE
secret	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
expected	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
went	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
wandered	I-QUOTE
eastward	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
soon	I-QUOTE
losing	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
way	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
labyrinth	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
grimy	I-QUOTE
streets	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
black	I-QUOTE
grassless	I-QUOTE
squares.	I-QUOTE

About	I-QUOTE
half-past	I-QUOTE
eight	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
passed	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
absurd	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
theatre	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
flaring	I-QUOTE
gas-jets	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
gaudy	I-QUOTE
play-bills.	I-QUOTE

A	I-QUOTE
hideous	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
amazing	I-QUOTE
waistcoat	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
beheld	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
standing	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
entrance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
smoking	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
vile	I-QUOTE
cigar.	I-QUOTE

had	I-QUOTE
greasy	I-QUOTE
ringlets	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
enormous	I-QUOTE
diamond	I-QUOTE

when	I-QUOTE

saw	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
took	I-QUOTE
off	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
hat	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
air	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
gorgeous	I-QUOTE
servility.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
amused	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
monster.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
laugh	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE

really	I-QUOTE

paid	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE

My	B-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
only	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
lives	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
really	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
shallow	I-QUOTE
people.	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
call	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
loyalty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
fidelity	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
call	I-QUOTE
either	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
lethargy	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
custom	I-QUOTE

their	I-QUOTE
lack	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE

Faithfulness	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
emotional	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
consistency	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
life	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
intellect	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
confession	I-QUOTE

failure.	I-QUOTE

Faithfulness	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
analyse	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
day.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
property	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
it.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
many	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
throw	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
afraid	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
others	I-QUOTE
might	I-QUOTE
pick	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
up.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
want	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
interrupt	I-QUOTE
you.	I-QUOTE

Go	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
story.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Well	B-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
found	I-QUOTE
myself	I-QUOTE
seated	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
horrid	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
private	I-QUOTE
box	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
vulgar	I-QUOTE
drop-scene	I-QUOTE
staring	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
face.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
looked	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
behind	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
curtain	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
surveyed	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
house.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
tawdry	I-QUOTE
affair	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
Cupids	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
cornucopias	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
third-rate	I-QUOTE
wedding-cake.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
gallery	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
pit	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
fairly	I-QUOTE
full	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
rows	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
dingy	I-QUOTE
stalls	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
empty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
person	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
suppose	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
called	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dress-circle.	I-QUOTE

Women	I-QUOTE
went	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
oranges	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
ginger-beer	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
there	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
terrible	I-QUOTE
consumption	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
nuts	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
on.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
It	B-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
just	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
palmy	I-QUOTE
days	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
British	I-QUOTE
drama.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Just	B-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
fancy	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
depressing.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
began	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
earth	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
caught	I-QUOTE
sight	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play-bill.	I-QUOTE

What	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
Idiot	I-QUOTE

or	I-QUOTE
Dumb	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
Innocent	I-QUOTE
.	I-QUOTE

Our	I-QUOTE
fathers	I-QUOTE
used	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
piece	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
believe.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
longer	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
live	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
more	I-QUOTE
keenly	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
feel	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
whatever	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
enough	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
our	I-QUOTE
fathers	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
enough	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
us.	I-QUOTE

In	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
This	B-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
good	I-QUOTE
enough	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
Romeo	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
Juliet.	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
must	I-QUOTE
admit	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
rather	I-QUOTE
annoyed	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
idea	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
seeing	I-QUOTE
Shakespeare	I-QUOTE
done	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
wretched	I-QUOTE
hole	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
place.	I-QUOTE

Still	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
felt	I-QUOTE
interested	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
sort	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
way.	I-QUOTE

At	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
rate	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
wait	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
act.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
dreadful	I-QUOTE
orchestra	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
presided	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
young	I-QUOTE
Hebrew	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
sat	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
cracked	I-QUOTE
piano	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
nearly	I-QUOTE
drove	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
last	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
drop-scene	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
drawn	I-QUOTE
up	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
play	I-QUOTE
began.	I-QUOTE

Romeo	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
stout	I-QUOTE
elderly	I-QUOTE
gentleman	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
corked	I-QUOTE
eyebrows	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
husky	I-QUOTE
tragedy	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
figure	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
beer-barrel.	I-QUOTE

Mercutio	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
almost	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
bad.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
played	I-QUOTE
by	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
low-comedian	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
who	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
introduced	I-QUOTE
gags	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
own	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
friendly	I-QUOTE
terms	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
pit.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
both	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
grotesque	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
scenery	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
looked	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
country-booth.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
Juliet	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
imagine	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
girl	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
seventeen	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
age	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
flowerlike	I-QUOTE
face	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
small	I-QUOTE
Greek	I-QUOTE
head	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
plaited	I-QUOTE
coils	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
dark-brown	I-QUOTE
hair	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
violet	I-QUOTE
wells	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
lips	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
petals	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
rose.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
loveliest	I-QUOTE
thing	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
said	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
pathos	I-QUOTE
left	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
unmoved	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
but	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
mere	I-QUOTE
beauty	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
fill	I-QUOTE
your	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
tears.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
hardly	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
girl	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
mist	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
tears	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
across	I-QUOTE
me.	I-QUOTE

And	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
heard	I-QUOTE
such	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
voice.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
low	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
deep	I-QUOTE
mellow	I-QUOTE
notes	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
fall	I-QUOTE
singly	I-QUOTE
upon	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
ear.	I-QUOTE
Then	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
became	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
little	I-QUOTE
louder	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
sounded	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
flute	I-QUOTE
or	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
distant	I-QUOTE
hautboy.	I-QUOTE

In	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
garden-scene	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
tremulous	I-QUOTE
ecstasy	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
hears	I-QUOTE
just	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
dawn	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
nightingales	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
singing.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
moments	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
later	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
wild	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
violins.	I-QUOTE

You	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
how	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
stir	I-QUOTE
one.	I-QUOTE

Your	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
voice	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Sibyl	I-QUOTE
Vane	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
two	I-QUOTE
things	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
shall	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
forget.	I-QUOTE

When	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
close	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
hear	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
says	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
different.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
don	I-QUOTE
t	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
which	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
follow.	I-QUOTE

Why	I-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE
Harry	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
love	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
everything	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

Night	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
go	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
see	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
play.	I-QUOTE

One	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
Rosalind	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
next	I-QUOTE
evening	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
Imogen.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
die	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
gloom	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
Italian	I-QUOTE
tomb	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
sucking	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
poison	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
lover	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
lips.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
watched	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
wandering	I-QUOTE
through	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
forest	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
Arden	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
disguised	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
pretty	I-QUOTE
boy	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
hose	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
doublet	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
dainty	I-QUOTE
cap.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
mad	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE
into	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
presence	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
guilty	I-QUOTE
king	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
given	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
rue	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
wear	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
bitter	I-QUOTE
herbs	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
taste	I-QUOTE
of.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
has	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
innocent	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
black	I-QUOTE
hands	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
jealousy	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
crushed	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
reedlike	I-QUOTE
throat.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
seen	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
age	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
every	I-QUOTE
costume.	I-QUOTE

Ordinary	I-QUOTE
women	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
appeal	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
s	I-QUOTE
imagination.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
limited	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
century.	I-QUOTE

No	I-QUOTE
glamour	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
transfigures	I-QUOTE
them.	I-QUOTE

One	I-QUOTE
knows	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
minds	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
easily	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE
knows	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
bonnets.	I-QUOTE

One	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
always	I-QUOTE
find	I-QUOTE
them.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
mystery	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
ride	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
park	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
morning	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
chatter	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
tea-parties	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
afternoon.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
stereotyped	I-QUOTE
smile	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
fashionable	I-QUOTE
manner.	I-QUOTE

They	I-QUOTE
are	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
obvious.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
actress	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

How	I-QUOTE
different	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
actress	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
!	I-QUOTE

why	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
ever	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
crime	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
come	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE

On	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
theatre	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
horrid	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
came	I-QUOTE
round	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
box	I-QUOTE
after	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
performance	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
offered	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
behind	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
scenes	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
introduce	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
furious	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
Juliet	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
dead	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
hundreds	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
years	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
body	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
lying	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
marble	I-QUOTE
tomb	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
Verona.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
blank	I-QUOTE
look	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
amazement	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
under	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
impression	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
taken	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE

something.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
I	B-QUOTE
am	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
surprised.	I-QUOTE

Then	B-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
asked	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
if	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
wrote	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
any	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
newspapers.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
even	I-QUOTE
read	I-QUOTE
them.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
terribly	I-QUOTE
disappointed	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
confided	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dramatic	I-QUOTE
critics	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
conspiracy	I-QUOTE
against	I-QUOTE

that	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE

bought.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
I	B-QUOTE
should	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE

was	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
right	I-QUOTE
there.	I-QUOTE
But	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
hand	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
judging	I-QUOTE
from	I-QUOTE
their	I-QUOTE
appearance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
them	I-QUOTE
can	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
be	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
all	I-QUOTE
expensive.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
Well	B-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
they	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
beyond	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
means	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
"	O
laughed	O

"	O
By	B-QUOTE
this	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
however	I-QUOTE

the	I-QUOTE
lights	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
put	I-QUOTE
out	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
theatre	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
go.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
wanted	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
try	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
cigars	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
strongly	I-QUOTE
recommended.	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
declined.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
next	I-QUOTE
night	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
course	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
arrived	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
place	I-QUOTE
again.	I-QUOTE

When	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
saw	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
made	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
low	I-QUOTE
bow	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
assured	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
munificent	I-QUOTE
patron	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
art.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
most	I-QUOTE
offensive	I-QUOTE
brute	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
though	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
extraordinary	I-QUOTE
passion	I-QUOTE
for	I-QUOTE
Shakespeare.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
once	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
with	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
air	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
pride	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
his	I-QUOTE
five	I-QUOTE
bankruptcies	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
entirely	I-QUOTE
due	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
The	O
Bard	O
,	O
as	B-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
insisted	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
calling	I-QUOTE
him.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
distinction.	I-QUOTE

"	O
"	O
It	B-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
distinction	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
dear	I-QUOTE
Dorian	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
great	I-QUOTE
distinction.	I-QUOTE

Most	I-QUOTE
people	I-QUOTE
become	I-QUOTE
bankrupt	I-QUOTE
through	I-QUOTE
having	I-QUOTE
invested	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
heavily	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
prose	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
life.	I-QUOTE

To	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
ruined	I-QUOTE
one	I-QUOTE

self	I-QUOTE
over	I-QUOTE
poetry	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
an	I-QUOTE
honour.	I-QUOTE

But	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
did	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
first	I-QUOTE

"	O

The	B-QUOTE
third	I-QUOTE
night.	I-QUOTE

She	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
been	I-QUOTE
playing	I-QUOTE
Rosalind.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
help	I-QUOTE
going	I-QUOTE
round.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
thrown	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE
flowers	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
looked	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
least	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
fancied	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
had.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
persistent.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
determined	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
take	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
behind	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
consented.	I-QUOTE

It	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
curious	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
wanting	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
know	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE

wasn	I-QUOTE

it	I-QUOTE
?	I-QUOTE

"	O

why	I-QUOTE

"	O

I	B-QUOTE
will	I-QUOTE
tell	I-QUOTE
you	I-QUOTE
some	I-QUOTE

"	O

Oh	I-QUOTE

she	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
shy	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
so	I-QUOTE
gentle.	I-QUOTE

There	I-QUOTE
is	I-QUOTE
something	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
child	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
her.	I-QUOTE
Her	I-QUOTE
eyes	I-QUOTE
opened	I-QUOTE
wide	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
exquisite	I-QUOTE
wonder	I-QUOTE
when	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
told	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
what	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
performance	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
she	I-QUOTE
seemed	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
unconscious	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
her	I-QUOTE
power.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
think	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
were	I-QUOTE
both	I-QUOTE
rather	I-QUOTE
nervous.	I-QUOTE

The	I-QUOTE
old	I-QUOTE
Jew	I-QUOTE
stood	I-QUOTE
grinning	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
doorway	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
dusty	I-QUOTE
greenroom	I-QUOTE

making	I-QUOTE
elaborate	I-QUOTE
speeches	I-QUOTE
about	I-QUOTE
us	I-QUOTE
both	I-QUOTE

while	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
stood	I-QUOTE
looking	I-QUOTE
at	I-QUOTE
each	I-QUOTE
other	I-QUOTE
like	I-QUOTE
children.	I-QUOTE

He	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
insist	I-QUOTE
on	I-QUOTE
calling	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
My	O
Lord	O

so	B-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
assure	I-QUOTE
Sibyl	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
anything	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
kind.	I-QUOTE

said	I-QUOTE
quite	I-QUOTE
simply	I-QUOTE

regarded	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
merely	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE

person	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
a	I-QUOTE
play.	I-QUOTE

science	O
that	O
each	O

would	O
be	O
revealed	O
to	O
us.	O
As	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
we	O
always	O
misunderstood	O
ourselves	O
and	O
rarely	O
understood	O
others.	O

Experience	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
ethical	O
value.	O

It	O
was	O
merely	O
the	O

to	O
their	O
mistakes.	O

Moralists	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
rule	O

regarded	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
mode	O
of	O
warning	O
,	O
had	O
claimed	O
for	O
it	O
a	O
certain	O
ethical	O
efficacy	O
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
character	O
,	O
had	O
praised	O
it	O
as	O
something	O
that	O
taught	O
us	O
what	O
to	O
follow	O
and	O
showed	O
us	O
what	O
to	O
avoid.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
motive	O
power	O
in	O
experience.	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
little	O
of	O
an	O
active	O
cause	O
as	O
conscience	O
itself.	O

All	O
that	O
it	O
really	O
demonstrated	O
was	O
that	O
our	O
future	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
our	O
past	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
sin	O
we	O
had	O
done	O

with	O

,	O
we	O

do	O
many	O

with	O

It	O
was	O
clear	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
experimental	O
method	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
method	O
by	O
which	O

fruitful	O

His	O
sudden	O
mad	O
love	O
for	O
Sibyl	O
Vane	O
was	O
a	O
psychological	O
phenomenon	O
of	O
no	O
small	O
interest.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O

with	O
it	O

curiosity	O
and	O
the	O
desire	O
for	O
new	O

,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
simple	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
a	O
very	O
complex	O
passion.	O

What	O
there	O
was	O
in	O
it	O
of	O

changed	O
into	O
something	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
the	O

himself	O
to	O
be	O
remote	O
from	O
sense	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
for	O
that	O
very	O
reason	O
all	O
the	O
more	O
dangerous.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
passions	O
about	O
whose	O
origin	O
we	O
deceived	O
ourselves	O
that	O
tyrannized	O
most	O
strongly	O
over	O
us.	O

Our	O
weakest	O
motives	O
were	O
those	O
of	O
whose	O
nature	O
we	O
were	O
conscious.	O

It	O
often	O
happened	O
that	O
when	O

one	O

he	O
with	O

live	O
in	O
an	O

Yes	O

there	O
were	O

he	O

and	O
not	O
lose	O
his	O
temper	O

or	O
spend	O
his	O

foolishly.	O

She	O
was	O
only	O
a	O

than	O
he	O
was	O

but	O
she	O
knew	O
so	O

God	O

in	O
a	O

he	O
would	O

made	O
no	O

Yet	O
it	O
