"	O
Mr.	O
Elton	O
looked	O
all	O
happiness	O
at	O
this	O
proposition	O
;	O
and	O
nothing	O
could	O
exceed	O
his	O
alertness	O
and	O
attention	O
in	O
conducting	O
them	O
into	O
his	O
house	O
and	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
make	O
every	O
thing	O
appear	O
to	O
advantage.	O

The	O
room	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
into	O
was	O
the	O
one	O
he	O
chiefly	O
occupied	O
,	O
and	O
looking	O
forwards	O
;	O
behind	O
it	O
was	O
another	O
with	O
which	O
it	O
immediately	O
communicated	O
;	O
the	O
door	O
between	O
them	O
was	O
open	O
,	O
and	O
Emma	O
passed	O
into	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
housekeeper	O
to	O
receive	O
her	O
assistance	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
comfortable	O
manner.	O
She	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
door	O
ajar	O
as	O
she	O
found	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
fully	O
intended	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Elton	O
should	O
close	O
it.	O
It	O
was	O
not	O
closed	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
it	O

remained	O
ajar	O
;	O

by	O
engaging	O
the	O
housekeeper	O
in	O

conversation	O

she	O
hoped	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
practicable	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
chuse	O
his	O
own	O
subject	O
in	O
the	O
adjoining	O
room.	O

For	O
ten	O
minutes	O
she	O
could	O
hear	O
nothing	O
but	O
herself.	O
It	O
could	O
be	O
protracted	O
no	O
longer.	O
She	O
was	O
then	O
obliged	O
to	O
be	O
finished	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
her	O
appearance.	O

The	O
lovers	O
were	O
standing	O

at	O
one	O
of	O

for	O
half	O

Emma	O
felt	O
the	O
glory	O
of	O

schemed	O
successfully.	O

But	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
do	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
