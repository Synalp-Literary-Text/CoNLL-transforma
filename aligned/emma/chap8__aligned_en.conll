a	O
bed-room	O

judged	O
it	O

to	O
keep	O
her	O
with	O
them	O
as	O

She	O

to	O
Mrs.	O

by	O
his	O

it	O

and	O
was	O

by	O
the	O

the	I-QUOTE
purpose	I-QUOTE

open	I-QUOTE

straightforward	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE

very	I-QUOTE
well	I-QUOTE

told	I-QUOTE

every	I-QUOTE

both	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
no	I-QUOTE
hesitation	I-QUOTE
in	I-QUOTE
advising	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE

proved	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
could	I-QUOTE
afford	I-QUOTE
it	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
that	I-QUOTE
being	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
case	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
was	I-QUOTE
convinced	I-QUOTE

could	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
do	I-QUOTE
better.	I-QUOTE

I	I-QUOTE
praised	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
fair	I-QUOTE
lady	I-QUOTE
too	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
altogether	I-QUOTE
sent	I-QUOTE
him	I-QUOTE
away	I-QUOTE
very	I-QUOTE
happy.	I-QUOTE

If	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
had	I-QUOTE
never	I-QUOTE
esteemed	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
opinion	I-QUOTE
before	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
he	I-QUOTE
would	I-QUOTE
have	I-QUOTE
thought	I-QUOTE
highly	I-QUOTE
of	I-QUOTE
me	I-QUOTE
then	I-QUOTE
;	I-QUOTE
and	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
I	I-QUOTE
dare	I-QUOTE
say	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
left	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
house	I-QUOTE

me	I-QUOTE
the	I-QUOTE
best	I-QUOTE

Now	I-QUOTE
,	I-QUOTE
as	I-QUOTE
we	I-QUOTE
may	I-QUOTE
fairly	I-QUOTE
suppose	I-QUOTE

would	I-QUOTE
not	I-QUOTE
allow	I-QUOTE
much	I-QUOTE
time	I-QUOTE
to	I-QUOTE
pass	I-QUOTE
