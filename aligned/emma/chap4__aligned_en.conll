Harriet	O

decided	O
in	O
her	O

Emma	O
lost	O
no	O
time	O
in	O
inviting	O

,	O
and	O
telling	O
her	O

As	O
a	O
walking	O
companion	O
,	O
Emma	O
had	O
very	O
early	O
foreseen	O
how	O
useful	O
she	O
might	O
find	O
her.	O
In	O
that	O
respect	O
Mrs.	O
Weston	O
's	O
loss	O
had	O
been	O
important.	O

Her	O
father	O
never	O
went	O
beyond	O
the	O
shrubbery	O
,	O
where	O
two	O
divisions	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
sufficed	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
long	O

or	O
his	O
short	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
year	O
varied	O
;	O
and	O
since	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
's	O
marriage	O
her	O
exercise	O
had	O
been	O
too	O
much	O
confined.	O
She	O
had	O
ventured	O
once	O
alone	O
to	O
Randalls	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
pleasant	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
Harriet	O
Smith	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
one	O
whom	O
she	O
could	O
summon	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
to	O
a	O
walk	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
valuable	O
addition	O
to	O
her	O
privileges.	O
But	O
in	O
every	O
respect	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
saw	O
more	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
approved	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
confirmed	O
in	O
all	O
her	O
kind	O
designs.	O
Harriet	O
certainly	O
was	O
not	O
clever	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
sweet	O
,	O
docile	O
,	O
grateful	O
disposition	O
,	O
was	O
totally	O
free	O
from	O
conceit	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
desiring	O
to	O
be	O
guided	O
by	O
any	O
one	O
she	O
looked	O
up	O
to.	O

Her	O
early	O
attachment	O
to	O
herself	O
was	O
very	O
amiable	O
;	O
and	O
her	O
inclination	O
for	O
good	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
power	O
of	O
appreciating	O
what	O
was	O
elegant	O
and	O
clever	O
,	O
shewed	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
want	O
of	O
taste	O
,	O
though	O
strength	O
of	O
understanding	O
must	O
not	O
be	O
expected.	O

Altogether	O
she	O
was	O
quite	O
convinced	O
of	O
Harriet	O
Smith	O
's	O
being	O
exactly	O
the	O
young	O
friend	O
she	O
wanted	O
--	O
exactly	O
the	O
something	O
which	O
her	O
home	O
required.	O
Such	O
a	O
friend	O
as	O
Mrs.	O
Weston	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

Two	O
such	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
granted.	O

Two	O
such	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
want.	O
It	O
was	O
quite	O
a	O
different	O
sort	O
of	O
thing	O
,	O
a	O
sentiment	O
distinct	O
and	O
independent.	O
Mrs.	O
Weston	O
was	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
a	O
regard	O
which	O
had	O
its	O
basis	O
in	O
gratitude	O
and	O
esteem.	O

Harriet	O
would	O
be	O
loved	O
as	O
one	O
to	O
whom	O
she	O
could	O
be	O
useful.	O

For	O
Mrs.	O

Weston	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
;	O
for	O
Harriet	O
every	O

Harriet	O
could	O

was	O
ready	O
to	O
tell	O
every	O
thing	O
in	O
her	O
power	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
questions	O
were	O

Emma	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
fancy	O
what	O
she	O
liked	O

but	O
she	O
could	O
never	O

that	O

raise	I-QUOTE
my	I-QUOTE
curiosity.	I-QUOTE
The	I-QUOTE

a	I-QUOTE
