on	O

the	O

another	O
rush	O
at	O

Alice	O
,	O
thinking	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
like	O
having	O
a	O
game	O
of	O
play	O
with	O
a	O
cart-horse	O
,	O
and	O
expecting	O
every	O
moment	O
to	O
be	O
trampled	O
under	O
its	O
feet	O
,	O
ran	O
round	O
the	O
thistle	O
again	O
;	O
then	O
the	O
puppy	O
began	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
short	O
charges	O
at	O
the	O
stick	O
,	O
running	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
way	O
forwards	O
each	O
time	O
and	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
barking	O
hoarsely	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
it	O
sat	O
down	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
off	O
,	O
panting	O
,	O
with	O
its	O
tongue	O
hanging	O
out	O
of	O
its	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
its	O
great	O
eyes	O
half	O
shut.	O

This	O
seemed	O
to	O
Alice	O
a	O
good	O
opportunity	O
for	O
making	O
her	O
escape	O
;	O
so	O
she	O
set	O
off	O
at	O
once	O

and	O
ran	O
till	O
she	O
was	O
quite	O
tired	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
breath	O

and	O
till	O
the	O
puppy	O
's	O
bark	O
sounded	O
quite	O
faint	O
in	O
the	O
